1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,870
Let's talk about the unwind
pipeline stage.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,230
In MongoDB, documents
can have arrays.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,100
And it's not easy to group on
something within an array

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,890
unless we move it out of
the array form and

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,520
make it more flat.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,530
So if you remember, this is sort
of pre-joined data when

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,130
you have a document
with an array.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,110
And what we're going to do is
we're going to use unwind to

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,940
unjoin the data and then
basically rejoin it in a way

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,710
that lets us do grouping
calculations on it.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,870
So let's look at an example.

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,510
Let's say I unwind on c.

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,770
What it's going to do is for
each document, it's going to

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,900
create a document with the
remainder of the document plus

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,590
each value from this array.

16
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,680
So this is what you'd get
for this document.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:01:01,240
You'd get a 1, B 2, c being
apple, a 1, b 2, c being pear,

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,250
and a 1, b 2, c being orange.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,140
So I got three documents as this
document passed through

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,670
the pipeline if I'm unwinding on
the dollar c, which is this

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,000
key right here.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,400
And once I do this unwind, what
I can do is I could group

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,580
by what I just unwound and count
something else or sum

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,180
something else.

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,620
That's typically the
way you'll use it.

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,130
And if there are five documents,
for example, and

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,970
each one has three elements in
the array, then you would get

28
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,340
15 documents out of
the unwind stage.

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,580
So there's sort of a data
explosion from unwind.

30
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,750
But we need that, because we
need the data in a way that

31
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,580
looks, honestly, a little bit
more tabular, a little bit

32
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,050
more relational, so that we
can then group it on the

33
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,720
elements in the array.

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,820
So time for quick quiz,
see if you understand

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,010
the way unwind works.

36
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,750
Let's say that we have the
following collection.

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,370
We have two elements
in the collection.

38
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,730
And the first one is Barack
Obama, and he likes social

39
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,860
justice, health care,
and taxes.

40
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,760
And the second one is Mitt
Romney, and he likes a

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,600
balanced budget, corporations,
and binders full of women.

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,070
So let's say you want
to unwind the likes

43
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,870
array of each document.

44
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,220
How many documents will you
wind up with when you pass

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,730
these two documents through
the collection?

46
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,980
