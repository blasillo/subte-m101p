1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,820
In this problem, we asked you
to figure out the average

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,220
population of cities in
California and New York that

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,260
have populations individually
over 25,000.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,210
And we also asked you to
consider a city that appears

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,180
in both states to be
a separate city.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,330
So if the same city name appears
in both states, it's a

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:17,980
separate city.

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,940
Now, it's a little tricky
because of that, but it's

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,240
fairly straightforward once
you sort of pull it apart.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,960
I know that for a lot of people,
some of the English

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,610
itself was probably the
most challenging part.

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,260
Now, we see that the
answer is 82,541.

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,560
So let's go through
this step by step.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,260
The first thing we do is we want
to look at the states,

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,660
California and New York.

17
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,710
Because this problem only refers
to those, so we can

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,710
immediately filter
out by that.

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,390
Then, we have to group by city
and state in order to separate

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,740
out the cities from the
two different states.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,330
That is, that a city that
appears in two different

22
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,100
states is a different city
and it will be considered

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,800
separately if we have the ID
for this grouping be state

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,000
comma city, which is
what we've done.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,620
And then, remember, we're
looking at these zip code

26
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,670
level records, and there
are multiple zip

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,350
codes in the same state.

28
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,630
We then take the population in
each zip code and add it to

29
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,910
that entry by state
comma city.

30
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,280
Now, we want to filter out
only for cities that have

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,260
population greater than 25,000,
so we do a matching

32
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,800
step right here.

33
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,200
And we look for population
greater than 25,000.

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,120
That's the match.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,953
And population is the field we
named here, so this field and

36
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,320
this field correspond
with each other.

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,720
And now, we just need to get the
average population across

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,740
all those cities.

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,240
So we need to do
a new grouping.

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,160
And this time, we're going to
group by ID null, which is a

41
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,980
way of getting a summation or an
aggregate across an entire

42
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,920
collection.

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,990
And we're just going to get the
average of the pop field.

44
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,560
Let's look at that and see
what the answer is.

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,240
And I've already run it here.

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,180
You can see that the answer
is 82,541.46,

47
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,810
or just 82,541 rounded.

48
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,080
And that was the answer
to the problem.

49
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,330
