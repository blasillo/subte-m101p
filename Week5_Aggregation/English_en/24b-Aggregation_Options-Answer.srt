1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,915
Okay, and the answer is the second one.

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:05,816
The second one is properly specified.
You can see here the aggregation stages

3
00:00:05,816 --> 00:00:10,173
are in an array, and 'allow disk use'
is specified with out a dollar sign

4
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:15,253
because you don't use a dollar sign
when specifying this literal for this option.

5
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:17,621
Now, the first one's wrong because
there's a dollar sign there

6
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,874
and it won't work, and you can try it 
to confirm that.

7
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:23,773
And the third one's wrong because
'allow disk use' is specified properly

8
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:29,738
without a dollar sign, but we've taken the
pipe line stages out of the array.

9
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:33,476
It's the older style specifying a 
navigation and it won't work with options

10
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:38,932
'cause mongoDB doesn't know whether
this is a pipeline stage or options.

11
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:41,580
And the last one is wrong, even though
it does use an array.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,894
It uses this dollar sign 
which is not the right way

13
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:46,533
to specify allowing disk use.
