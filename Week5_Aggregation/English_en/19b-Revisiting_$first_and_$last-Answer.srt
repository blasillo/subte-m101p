1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,200

2
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,110
And the answer is
that it is 54.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,280
And you can probably pretty much
reason this out, but I'll

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,500
work on it with you.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,720
So, match a 0.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,220
So that matches only the first
four documents here.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,140
So the first four documents
have an a value of 0.

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,260
We're going to sort
by c descending.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,660
So, c descending.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,850
So, let's see.

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:33,200
The larges c value is 54, then
52, then 17, then 21.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,640
And then we're going
to do a group on a.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,670
We only have 80 values left
that are zero, so that's

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,120
pretty trivial.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,260
And we're going to get the first
c value, and so that

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,760
will be 54, and that
was the answer.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,010
