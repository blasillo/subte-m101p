1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,180

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,720
OK.

3
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,150
And the answer is, you're going
to wind up with six

4
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,550
documents, because you're
going to wind up with a

5
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,580
document for Barack Obama and
likes social justice, Barack

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,630
Obama and likes health care,
Barack Obama and likes taxes.

7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,780
And the same thing
with Mitt Romney.

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,210
He has three elements in his
array, so we get another three

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,640
documents there, for a total
of six documents after the

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,890
unwind stage.
