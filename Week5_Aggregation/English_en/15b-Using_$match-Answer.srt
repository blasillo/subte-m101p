1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,970
OK.

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,890
And the answer is
db.zips.aggregate, and then we

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,590
use a $match phase in the
pipeline and ask for the

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,840
documents where pop is dollar
sign greater than 100,000.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,350
That's it.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,600
Just like a find.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,250
