1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,988
Ok!

2
00:00:00,988 --> 00:00:04,538
And it turns out the first two are true,
and the last two are not true.

3
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:08,350
And in particular, you cannot use 
the $text operator

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,221
unless there is also a full text search 
index on the underlying collection.

5
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:17,311
And, the results will not be sorted 
by the strength of the full text match,

6
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:22,642
unless you also put in a sort phase
that acts as some of the meta-information

7
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:25,272
that's available from 
full text search matching.
