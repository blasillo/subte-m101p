1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,160
And the answer is yes, we went
through that earlier, which is

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,140
basically that if you set that
to be equal to one, j equal to

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,740
one, and the right one to the
primary, and the primary goes

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,320
down before it propagates the
right to the secondary, and

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,640
the secondary comes back, the
secondary becomes primary.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,130
Then when the original primary
returns, he's going to roll

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,790
himself back because he's a
head of the other primary.

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,370
He's not going to
send that one.

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,950
And he'll put that
into a file.

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,670
So yes, it is possible.

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,093
