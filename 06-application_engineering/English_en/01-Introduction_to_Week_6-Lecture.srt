00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,950
Welcome to week six.

3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,315
This week we're going to do
application engineering.

4
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:07,690
The two major topics are
replication and sharding.

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,450
Replication is a technique for
introducing a degree of fault

6
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,340
tolerance to MongoDB,
asynchronously replicating

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,070
your data amongst multiple
nodes running MongoDB.

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,370
And what we're going to talk
about is what you need to know

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,440
as an engineer, as a developer,
dealing with a

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,750
replicated environment.

11
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,900
The next topic is sharding.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,400
So sharding is the way we
scale out in Mongo.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,980
We allow you to split
a collection up

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,260
amongst multiple instances.

15
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,260
And you're going to need to
know a few things as a

16
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,720
developer to deal with
sharded environments.

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,815
Firstly, you're going to need to
know how to create a shard

18
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:44,110
key and how to write queries
that work in a sharded

19
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,950
environment.

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,880
So we're going to
talk about that.

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,130
So let's get started.

22
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,050
