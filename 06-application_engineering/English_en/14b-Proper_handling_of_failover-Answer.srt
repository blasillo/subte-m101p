1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,750
OK.

3
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,030
And the answer is no.

4
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,440
And the reason the answer
is no is that

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,530
we retry three times.

6
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,910
And we sleep five seconds.

7
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,480
So this presumes that a new
primary is elected within 15

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,870
seconds, which may
be the case.

9
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,880
But it may not be the case.

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,710
So if you retry 20 times, and
if you waited longer and

11
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,500
longer each time, then it
becomes very unlikely that the

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,660
write wouldn't succeed.

13
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,790
You could probably get that down
in a well managed network

14
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,550
as something that was so low,
it wouldn't matter.

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,960
But the point is, in this
particular case, the way it's

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,510
structured with just the three
retries and a five second

17
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,790
sleep, it may not complete
because you may go through all

18
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,630
the retries while the election
is still occurring if there

19
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,850
are other problems existing
on your network.

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,410
Under normal circumstances, an
election for a new primary is

21
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,570
going to happen within a half
second to a second.

22
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,820
