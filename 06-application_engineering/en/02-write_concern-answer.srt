1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,110
OK, and the answer is, as we
talked about, w equals 1.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,860
I want to make sure I
acknowledge the write.

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,940
And j equals 1, I want to make
sure it's journaled.

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,210
These other answers are
wrong in various ways.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,140
w equals zero won't wait at all
for an acknowledgement, or

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,240
for journaling.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,710
w equals 2, I'll just
foreshadow this.

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,330
We'll wait for the node that
you're talking to, the primary

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,520
node and, and one other note
in a replica set to

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,820
acknowledge the write, but
none of them necessarily

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,770
journaling it.

13
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,600
And w equals 1, j equal 0.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,720
We'll wait for the node you're
talking to to acknowledge the

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,550
write, but it won't wait for
it to get journaled all the

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,800
way to disk.
