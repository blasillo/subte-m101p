1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,570
A site that you should
definitely know about now that

3
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,160
you're leaving our course
is api.mongodb.org.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,320
This is the main directory of
all the drivers and the

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,820
various versions of the drivers
that you'll be using

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,010
as a developer.

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,310
Now, I didn't tell you about
that earlier on in the course

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,040
because I didn't
know about it.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,560
And I didn't know about it
because I myself have been

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,400
learning MongoDB for the last
few months, and I wasn't aware

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,770
that we had this high
level site.

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,680
So I want to take you through
that now and show you the

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,000
changes that have occurred to
the Python driver in the last

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,170
two weeks, and also just
about every other

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,110
driver that we support.

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,510
So if you go to api.mongodb.org,
you can see

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,755
all the different
drivers listed.

18
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:45,090
I'm going to click on Python.

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,250
You can see that the current
version is 2.4.

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,670
You probably have
2.3 installed.

21
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,210
You should update to 2.4 using
the instructions on the page.

22
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,690
I think it's easy_install
-U for Mac users.

23
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,910
I did it earlier.

24
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,520
If you click on 2.4, that
looks familiar to you.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,500
But sometimes Google will point
to the older driver, so

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,220
it's good to start at
api.mongodb.org.

27
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,300
And now I'm going to
go down to API.

28
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,830
And you can see that one of
the major classes is the

29
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,850
connection class that we used
earlier in the class to

30
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,060
connect using Python.

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,850
And if we click on that, it
warns us that, in fact, it is

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,960
deprecated and that we should
use mongo_client instead.

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,120
Now, there is some version of
mongo_client for every single

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,580
one of the drivers we support.

35
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,550
This was a major roll out last
week to change our defaults so

36
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,150
that we acknowledge rights to
the database and don't fire

37
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,395
and forget anymore.

38
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:42,070
If we click there onto
mongo_client, we get all the

39
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,740
various options for that.

40
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,940
Now, in the Python driver,
you don't see the words

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,720
WriteConcern very often.

42
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,630
And WriteConcern is not used
consistently in our

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,940
documentation, but it's taken to
mean, as far as I can tell,

44
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,540
the combination of [? WJ ?]

45
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,710
and sometimes wtimeout
parameters taken together.

46
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,790
But you can see all the
different options that you can

47
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,330
give the driver.

48
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,430
W is the one we've been talking
about, acknowledging

49
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,410
the writes.

50
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,410
We'll get to wtimeout as soon as
we get to replication, talk

51
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,750
about what that is.

52
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,822
J is whether or not you're
going to wait

53
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:15,195
for it to be journaled.

54
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:16,490
And there's a few others,
and I want to go

55
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,820
over them right now.

56
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,110
But let's go over a program so
you can see what a program

57
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,040
looks like using the
new drivers.

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,510
Since we've been writing in a
different style for the entire

59
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,590
course, I want to make sure you
guys get to see the most

60
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,390
recent one.

61
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,880
So here's a small program that's
written using the new

62
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,260
MongoClient class versus the
connection class that we used

63
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,370
earlier on in the course.

64
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,470
C equals Pymongo.mongoclient.

65
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,930
The host is the host
I'm connecting to.

66
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,890
W equals 2, and J equals true.

67
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,860
DB equals CMO101.

68
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,150
People equals DB.people.

69
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,600
And then I do some inserts.

70
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
And this is an alternative to
using the connection class.

71
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,030
The difference here is that even
if I gave no W equals 2,

72
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,060
if I did not specify w equals
2 or J equals true--

73
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,970
and I'll specify W equals 1,
since we've haven't gone over

74
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,070
replication yet--

75
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,090
even if I just left this blank,
the default would be

76
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,050
[? w=1, j=false. ?]

77
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,040
And that's a change
from before.

78
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,210
Before we specified safe mode
using the old connection

79
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,830
class, which gave us
[? w=1, j=false. ?]

80
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,220
And now [? w=1, j=false ?]

81
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,510
is the default for
all connections.

82
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,830
And the old connection class
is going to deprecated, so

83
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,710
you're encouraged to
use this new one.

84
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,560
OK, hope that wasn't
overly complicated.

85
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,140
I want to go back to the
driver site now.

86
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,560
I want to show you some of the
other drivers, in particular--

87
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,580
and there's a little bit of
inconsistency around this, so

88
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,980
you should realize it.

89
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,040
If you go into the Java driver,
it too now has a new

90
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,550
MongoClient class.

91
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,780
I'm going to click on
there for you fans.

92
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,000
Here's MongoClient.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,770
It's a new class that was
released just last week.

94
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,790
Again, it's the new suggested
default so that you get J

95
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,520
equals 0, W equals 1
on new connections.

96
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,720
Now, to build the options
to MongoClient, do this.

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,550
And you can see one
of the options--

98
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,070
there's actually a
builder for this.

99
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,570
We haven't gone through
Java in this class.

100
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,630
Some of you are Java
developers--

101
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,200
I'm sure you're familiar
with this idiom.

102
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,550
But if you look here, there's
this concept of WriteConcern.

103
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,810
And this WriteConcern here,
again, this is a further

104
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,680
elaboration of what those
different modes do.

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,910
I've gone over W equals
0 and W equals 1.

106
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,750
You can see there's actually a
meaning for W equals minus 1,

107
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,530
don't even report
network errors.

108
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,640
And 2+, waiting for
the secondaries

109
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,590
and the replica sets.

110
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,140
We'll get to that in a second.

111
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,470
wtimeout, which we'll
talk about later.

112
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,670
And the J option.

113
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,490
So the interesting thing about
this for me is that it's

114
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,810
called WriteConcern, which sort
of grabs it all together

115
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,980
as a concept.

116
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,720
And I haven't seen that in the
Python driver, per se.

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,050
But generally speaking, when
people talk about WriteConcern

118
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,950
in MongoDB, they're talking
about the J and W parameters,

119
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,500
and maybe the wtimeout
parameter.

120
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,410
Talking about whether or not
you wait for writes to be

121
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,920
acknowledged, and whether you
wait for journaling on the

122
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,280
primary node that
you're hitting.

123
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,520
And then we'll get to the rest
when we get to replication.

124
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,990
All right, so just to summarize,
there is a new

125
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,520
class out there, I think in
all the drivers, actually,

126
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,590
called MongoClient.

127
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,520
And it replaces the previous
connection methods.

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,660
And the difference is that it
by default calls get last

129
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,350
error with W equals
1, J equals o.

130
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,710
All right.

131
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,400
Let's do a quiz.

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,540
In a 2.4 release of Pymongo
a new connection class is

133
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,370
introduced that automatically
sets W equals 1

134
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:27,970
and J equals 0.

135
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,130
It essentially defaults to what
used to be called safe

136
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,110
mode and replaces the old
connection class.

137
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,540
What is the name
of that class?

138
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,000
MongoSafe, SafeConnection,
MongoClient, or

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,940
FireAndRemember?

140
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,190
Check the right answer.
