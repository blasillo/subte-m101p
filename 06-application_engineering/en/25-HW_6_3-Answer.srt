1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,330
OK, in this question we asked
you, which of the following

3
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,030
statements are true about
choosing a shard key?

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,140
The first one was the shard
key must be unique.

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,940
This is not true.

6
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,170
You can have a shard key
that is not unique.

7
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,060
The second is that there must be
an index on the collection

8
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,600
the starts with a shard key.

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,030
So that is true.

10
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,410
And if you start with an empty
collection, MongoDB will put

11
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,970
that index in the collection
for you.

12
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,770
If the collection has data in
it and you try to shard on a

13
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,730
particular key, it will expect
the index to be there, or the

14
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,240
creation of the shard
key will fail.

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,350
The next is that Mongo cannot
enforce any unique indexes on

16
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,480
a sharded collection other than
the shard key itself.

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,480
And that is true.

18
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,540
The only key that can be
enforced for uniqueness is the

19
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,010
shard key, so keep in mind.

20
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,480
This actually comes up if you
decide to shard on a key other

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,750
than the underscore ID key,
because the underscore ID key

22
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,470
must be unique.

23
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,840
But Mongo can't help you keep
it unique if it's not the

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,950
shard key on a sharded
collection.

25
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,440
And so it was your

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,250
responsibility to keep it unique.

27
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,590
This is not usually a big deal
if you're using BSON IDs,

28
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,260
because they are guaranteed
to be unique.

29
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,330
But if you decide to, let's say,
shard on something other

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,060
than the underscore ID, and the
underscore ID itself is

31
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,280
not a BSON ID for whatever
reason, then it's up to you to

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,490
keep it unique or bad
things will happen.

33
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,920
The next one is that any update
that does not contain a

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,890
shard key will be sent
to all shards.

35
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,030
So that is absolutely true.

36
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,940
The database, if it does not
get the shard key in the

37
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,990
query, will need to send the
query to all the shards.

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,900
It's a so-called scatter
gather operation.

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,050
So keep that in mind.

40
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,940
And the last one is that you
can change a shard key on a

41
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,150
collection if you desire.

42
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,170
Absolutely false.

43
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,060
It's quite permanent
and immutable.

44
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,100
You cannot change a shard
key on a collection.

45
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,490
And if you want to change a
shard key on a collection, you

46
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,740
would have to essentially dump
data, re-import it in some way

47
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,070
into a new collection with
a new shard key,

48
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,320
which would be painful.

49
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,530
