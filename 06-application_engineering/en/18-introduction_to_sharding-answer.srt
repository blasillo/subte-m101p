1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,880
OK, so this is a little
bit tricky.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,780
OK, the answer is three.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,180
All right, the shard key is not

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,320
including in the find operation.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,950
There are three shards,
each one a replica

7
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,030
set of three nodes.

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,440
How many nodes will see
the find operation?

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,480
So it will go to all three of
the shards, but only to one of

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,210
the nodes within each shard
because it's a replica set.

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,630
So wherever the current primary
and the default

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,620
configuration will get that
read, and therefore, it will

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,280
only be seen by three
actual Mongod's

14
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,530
and that's the answer.
