1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
And the answer is no.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,620
During that short time, and
failover is usually under

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,790
three seconds.

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,900
During that short time when
failover is occurring and a

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,180
new primary is being
collected, no.

6
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,060
You cannot complete a write,
and you'll get error inside

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,490
your program if you're
trying to write.

8
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,850
And so you definitely want
to be catching those, and

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,860
potentially retrying them for a
while to make sure that it's

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,080
not just a transient
thing where you're

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,330
going through failover.

12
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,440
