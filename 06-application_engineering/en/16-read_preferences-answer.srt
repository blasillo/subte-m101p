1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,100
And the first three are true.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,690
These are all potential reasons
why you might not want

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,220
to read from secondaries.

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,439
The last one is not true.

6
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:10,620
Reading from a secondary does
not prevent it from being

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,550
promoted to a primary

8
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,270
The other thing to consider is
that sometimes, if you're

9
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,085
deploying hardware, you need to
make sure that the hardware

10
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:20,530
you're deploying for your
secondary is the same level of

11
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,530
performance as your primary.

12
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,900
Otherwise, it could be
impossible for it to satisfy

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,910
those reads.

14
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,210
So anyway, it's OK to read from
secondaries, as long as

15
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,940
it's a thoughtful thing to do,
and it's something that you

16
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,410
did based on deliberate reasons,
versus just thinking,

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,080
well, it's a generally
good thing.

18
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,230
Because if you have no reason
to do it, you probably just

19
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,450
have your reads go
to the primary.

20
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,700
OK.
