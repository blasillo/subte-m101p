1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,600
OK.

3
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,720
And the answer is that the
entire data set will be copied

4
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,610
from the primary.

5
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,220
That's going to be a slow,
inefficient operation, but it

6
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,130
will work properly, even if
the op log has looped.

7
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,380
