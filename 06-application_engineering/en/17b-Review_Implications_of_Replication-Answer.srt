1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,285

2
00:00:00,285 --> 00:00:00,570
OK.

3
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,360
And the answer is it takes
a really long time.

4
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,940
So it probably, I actually tried
this on my computer, it

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,390
took at least 10
minutes or so.

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,600
At that point, you're subject to
the TCP timeout, which can

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,920
be extremely long.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,690
Because basically, you've said
I want to wait until I get an

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,210
acknowledgement from
four nodes.

10
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,850
There's only three nodes, and
so it'll just time out.

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,760
So just generally speaking, this
is just a reminder that

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,120
you need to set the w timeout
if for any reason you think

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,095
there's a possibility that the
number of nodes that you're

14
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:35,010
asking to commit to, or
not commit to, but get

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,860
acknowledged from is greater
than the number that are up.

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,070
Like, if you put w equals 3, and
there's a possibility that

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,540
you're running in a state
where there's only two

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,140
nodes that's up.

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,440
All right.

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,690
That's it.

21
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,290
