1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,260
And the answer is the missing
node will be discovered as

3
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,400
long as you list at least one
valid inside the seed list.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,710
So you don't have to
list everything

5
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,750
inside the replica set.

6
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,000
They're sort of self-discovery.
