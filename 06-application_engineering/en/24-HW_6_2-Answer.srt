1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,070

2
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,440
This question, we're asking you
to imagine a five-member

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,410
replica set, and figure out
how you would specify that

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,800
writes are committed to the
journal, and acknowledge by at

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,790
least three nodes, before
you proceed.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,470
So, what things would you need
in the getLastError call,

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,120
essentially?

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,780
And the answer is that you would
need w = 3 and j = 1.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,600
So you'd want to wait
for three nodes--

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,770
if you want to wait for
three of the five

11
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,600
nodes to get the write.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,910
So, the answer is
w = 3 and j = 1.

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,630
There isn't a w = 3,
j = 1 answer here.

14
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,420
There's a w = "majority"
and j = 1.

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,660
But the majority of five
nodes is three notes.

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,330
So that was the answer here.

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,950
And these other ones are wrong,
for obvious reasons.

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,670
Either w does not
equal 3 here--

19
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,220
here w = 3, but j does
not equal 1.

20
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,920
So we didn't wait for it to be
committed to the journal.

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,510
Here, you're waiting for all the
nodes to acknowledge the

22
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,960
write, and here--

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,000
this doesn't make any sense.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,680
There is no j = 3 value.

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,330
j, if you set it to
more than one--

26
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,750
it's either true or
false, really.

27
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,430
And if it's true, then it waits
for the write on the

28
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,410
primary node.

29
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,340
There's no way to say, you
want to wait for it to be

30
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,914
journaled on the secondary
nodes.

31
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:06,350
That doesn't exist in MongoDB.

32
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,600
