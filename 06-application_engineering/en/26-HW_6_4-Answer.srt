00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,515
This question, we asked you to
imagine a sharded system with

3
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:05,960
three shards, and wanted you
to figure out where a

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,990
particular query would go to
on the sharded system.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,470
So this was the sh.status
output.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,220
And you can see that, at the
bottom, it shows you the range

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,760
of student_ids and where they
potentially map to.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,750
So, for instance, from
student_id 0 to 2640 goes to

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,730
shard 0, and from minKey
to 0 goes to shard 1.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,040
We specifically asked you
about the query where

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,650
student_id is 530289, and you
can see that that's a range

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,070
specified right here.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,600
It falls in between here--
between 509266 and 596849.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,590
And so it sits on shard 1.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,070
And that, in fact, is
the answer-- that

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,320
it is on shard 1.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,530
