1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280

2
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,730
And the answer is that it has to
be an index on the zip code

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,710
or non-multi-key index that
starts with the zip code.

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,330
So that's the answer to that.

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,580
