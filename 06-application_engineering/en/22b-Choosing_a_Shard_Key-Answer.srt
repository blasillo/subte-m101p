1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,660
And the answer is that the
first three are true.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,110
The posttime will cause
hotspotting because it's

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,240
monotonically increasing.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,130
The username should be posts
well across the shards.

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,090
I think that would actually
be a good choice.

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,470
And choosing visible_to is
illegal because, remember, you

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,740
can index that is going to be
on the shard or the starting

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,180
part of the shard key and
visible_to will acquire a

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,480
multi-key index and
that's illegal.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,730
And then, choosing posttime as
a shard key suffers from low

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,320
cardinality.

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,540
It does not.

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,780
Posttimes are going to
be very varied, lots

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,420
of different values.

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,070
It just happens to be that
they are monotonically

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,630
increasing.

18
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,580
It's going to cause hotspotting
on the inserts.

19
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,830
So that's the answer.

20
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,690
