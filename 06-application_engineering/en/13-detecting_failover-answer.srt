1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,410
OK.

3
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,160
And the answer is no.

4
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,950
You're not guaranteed to
have them succeed.

5
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,540
Your program won't terminate.

6
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,620
But if all you do is just catch
the exception, then the

7
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,670
write won't complete.

8
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,650
And your program will
continue forward.

9
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,066
And depending on how the program
is structured, you may

10
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,890
not even realize that you
missed that write.

11
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,140
