1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320

2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,540
And of course, the
answer is three.

3
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,870
And as I said before, that's
because if you had fewer than

4
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,100
three, then what would remain,
let's say two nodes, or one

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,780
node if there were fewer than
three, if you had two nodes,

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,740
would not be a majority.

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,310
And so you couldn't
elect any primary.

8
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,560
