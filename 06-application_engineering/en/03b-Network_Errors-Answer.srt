1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,180

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,510
OK.

3
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,960
And the first three of these are
all possible reasons why

4
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,980
you may have some uncertainty
with your right commit

5
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,670
completed, even in a situation
where you did nod-- when you

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,850
got an error back.

7
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,840
The last one is not.

8
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,700
We don't offer transactions, and
there is no rollback due

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,340
to a violation of the primary
key constraint.

10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,870
So that was just sort
of made up.
