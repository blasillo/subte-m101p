1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,450
OK, now that we've got
MongoDB installed on Windows,

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,300
the next step is to get
Python installed on Windows.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,510
You might already have
Python installed on Windows,

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,470
and if you do you
can skip this step.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,260
But a lot of folks don't so I'm
going to show you how to do it.

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm in Google and I'm
going to type "download

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,550
Python for Windows."

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,270
And when I do that I
get to the first URL

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,990
is Python releases for
Windows, Python.org.

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,900
And then it looks like the first
download link is what I need,

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,110
but I'm just going to
scroll down for a second.

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,520
And its Python 2.7.9,
we're not going

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,070
to use Python 3 series
for this course.

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,480
So if we go down
here, what do we have?

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,020
We've got some downloads.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,540
Let's see, Gzipped source,
I don't want to compile it,

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,100
Mac OS, I don't want to
do that, Windows debug

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,440
information files.

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,170
Windows x86-64 MSI installer,
this looks good to me.

21
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,691
For AMD, for EMT, x86, not
for Itanium processors.

22
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:56,690
Well, I don't think I
have an Itanium processor,

23
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,640
so I'll try that.

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,110
And now I'm going to run that.

25
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,500
Install for all users.

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,480
It's going to install it at
C colon slash Python27 slash.

27
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,300
OK, that sounds good.

28
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,930
All right, and I
say Yes to that.

29
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,020
All right, seems to
be doing its work.

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,080
Oh, it's installing set
up tools including pip,

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,621
I read that on the
screen, it's going

32
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,894
to be very convenient for us.

33
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:22,810
So even if you have an
older version of Python

34
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,787
you might want to
install this one.

35
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:27,245
You must restart your system
for your configuration changes

36
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,990
to take effect, click Yes
to restart now or No if you

37
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,400
plan to manually restart later.

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,450
Wow, full restart.

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,430
OK, well I'm going to
restart the computer

40
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,900
and then I'll pick this
up after it restarts.

41
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,795
OK, we're back post
reboot now and we're

42
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,920
going to finish up the
process of installing Python

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,270
on this Windows
PC by making sure

44
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,260
that the path is set correctly.

45
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,480
So to do that we
go over to System

46
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,130
and we click on
Advanced System Settings

47
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,220
and then we click on
Environment Variables.

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,900
And then for
environment variables

49
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,590
we scroll down here, find
the path, there it is.

50
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,570
And now we're going
to edit the path,

51
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,780
and now I'm going to position
the mouse at the very end

52
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,610
and I'm going to put
the separator in,

53
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,640
which is a semicolon.

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,620
So I put in C colon
slash Python27 slash.

55
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,940
And that should do it.

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:26,440
So let's say OK to that and
OK to that and OK to that.

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,880
And now if we bring up a
shell and if we type Python

58
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,210
we get the Python
2.7.9 interpreter

59
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,570
and now we're going to
just print "Hello World",

60
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,060
and we see Hello World.

61
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,140
And Python is
installed on this PC.

62
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,787
OK, so Python is now
installed on Windows,

63
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:48,620
but the last piece we
need to also make sure

64
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,197
that we get right is that
we have the Python setup

65
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:53,780
tools in our path,
because we're going

66
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,530
to want to use pip, which is
an installer, P-I-P. If we

67
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,000
try to do that right now
we can't because it's not

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,820
in our path.

69
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,900
Now, I searched using
Windows Explorer

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,640
and found that it was actually
in Python 2.7 Scripts.

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,550
So let's go ahead and change
our path to include that.

72
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,060
So once again we're going to
go to System, Advanced System

73
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,270
Properties,
Environment Variables,

74
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,730
we're going to scroll
down to this path variable

75
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,010
and we're going to
edit it one more time.

76
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,400
And this time we're going to add
another semicolon at the end.

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,640
And then C colon slash
Python27 slash scripts.

78
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,280
And I believe that it
was actually capitalized,

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,090
although I think it's case
preserving and case insensitive

80
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,730
so I don't think it matters.

81
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,700
So let's do that, say OK, and
now let's get another shell.

82
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,360
When I right click
I get a shell.

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,130
And then let's see if pip
is actually installed.

84
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,950
Excellent.

85
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,560
Now if I type "pip" I can
actually install things.

86
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,550
That's going to be very
useful for installing

87
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,960
PyMongo and installing Bottle.

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,950
So that's the end of the
installing Python lesson.
