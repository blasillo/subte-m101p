1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,460
In this segment we're
going to install MongoDB

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,862
3.0 on Microsoft Windows.

4
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:06,820
And I'm going to take
you through all the steps

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,920
to do that.

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,780
Now I've got a Microsoft
Windows 8 computer here,

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,030
and it is running the
traditional desktop.

8
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,290
And I'll show you how to
find and download MongoDB.

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,700
So go to Google and
type download MongoDB,

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,220
and that will take you
to this first link.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,680
The first organic link
is mongodb.org/download.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,010
Let's click on that.

13
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,770
And then at the top
you can see there's

14
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,950
an option to use the
MongoDB Management

15
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,995
Service to run MongoDB.

16
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:34,120
We're not going to do that.

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,805
We're going to actually run
it ourselves on our computer.

18
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:39,010
And right now, at the
time of this recording,

19
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,880
we had the 3.0.0 release
that's available.

20
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,980
And when you see it, it may
be a slightly newer version.

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,270
It may be 3.0.1 or
3.0.2 or beyond.

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,520
We're going to take the
64-bit release because this

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,270
is a 64-bit operating system.

24
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,240
We recommend the 64-bit release.

25
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,090
We definitely do not recommend
using a 32-bit release

26
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,610
for production because it
limits the total addressable

27
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,580
size of the data using the
default storage engine.

28
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,481
I'm going to download
the MSI file.

29
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:05,980
OK.

30
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,460
Now the MSI file is downloaded.

31
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,040
And now I'm going
to run it, which

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,940
is going to install
MongoDB on the computer.

33
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,835
So we're going to
click through Next.

34
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,440
We're going to accept
the license agreement.

35
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,700
Next again.

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,340
I'm going to take a Complete
install, and install it.

37
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,950
It's going to ask me if I'm
serious about installing it,

38
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,070
and yes I am.

39
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,581
And then it's going
to click Finish.

40
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:32,580
Now where did it put it?

41
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,580
Well, I'll show you
where it put it.

42
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:40,890
It put it in C drive, Program
Files, MongoDB, right here--

43
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,810
Server 3.0, bin.

44
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,420
OK?

45
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,150
So that's where it is.

46
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,520
Now let's see what's
in this directory.

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,620
So in this directory are
a bunch of executables.

48
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,160
And the ones we care about
the most are Mongo and MongoD.

49
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,294
Mongo is the shell, and
MongoD is the server.

50
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,210
Now we want to run this
from the command line.

51
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,800
Before we do that let's
do a couple of things.

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,980
First of all, let's
change our path

53
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,820
so that we have access to
this directory from the shell.

54
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,860
So I'm going to
go here to System.

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,840
I'm going to click on
Advanced System Settings.

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,380
And then I'm going to click
on Environment Variables.

57
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,600
And then I'm going to go to the
Path Variable right down here.

58
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,550
Let's scroll down and
find a Path Variable.

59
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,810
Path, of course, is where
Windows looks for executables

60
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,940
from the command prompt.

61
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,570
And then I'm going to
add something to it.

62
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,500
So what I want to add is I want
to add this directory right

63
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,700
here.

64
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,770
Perfect.

65
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,140
So I'm going to select that.

66
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,330
I left clicked on it, and
then it actually selected it.

67
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,330
This is exactly what
I wanted, because that

68
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,130
will let me do a copy
of it without having

69
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,690
to completely retype it.

70
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,400
And now, I go back to
my Environment Variables

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,140
and go to the end, and then
I'm going to hit Paste.

72
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,320
And I say, OK.

73
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,780
And then I'm going to say, OK.

74
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,260
And I'm going to say, OK.

75
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,300
Now that I've done that,
I should be able to,

76
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,130
in a new shell, get
to these executables.

77
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,720
So let me get a new shell.

78
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,930
Right click on the Start
menu, Command Prompt.

79
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,691
And now if I type MongoD,
it should start up.

80
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,190
Now there's one other thing we
need to do before we do this.

81
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,820
We need a slash data
slash db directory,

82
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,520
which is where MongoD is
going to put the data.

83
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,460
So let's do that md slash
data, md slash data slash db.

84
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,790
And now let's type
mongod and hit Return.

85
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,560
And when we do that,
you can see that.

86
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,280
We're seeing a log from MongoD.

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,370
And it's still running, so it's
still printing out the log.

88
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,130
The program hasn't exited.

89
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,380
It's just the log is running
right to the Command Prompt.

90
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,090
And if you read
the log messages,

91
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,790
you can see that it
tells you that it's

92
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,140
listening on port
27017, and that it's

93
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,290
putting its data in data
slash db, which is a default.

94
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,650
Now let's get another
shell right here.

95
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,060
And now let's run the
Mongo Shell program.

96
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,270
Before we were running MongoD.

97
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,770
Now we're just
going to run Mongo.

98
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,025
And we're going to hit Return.

99
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:12,300
And that's going to make a
connection to local host 27017.

100
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,650
And when we did that, we can
put something into the database.

101
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,459
So I'm going to put db.names.

102
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,589
So db-- I'm in a test database,
names of the collection-- dot

103
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,190
insert.

104
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,740
I'm going to put a
document with one key name,

105
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,110
and with the value
being my name.

106
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,140
And it says that we
wrote one document.

107
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,380
And now if we query
the collection,

108
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,400
we see there's a document with
an underscore ID, name Andrew

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,280
Erlichson.

110
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,240
So we've successfully
gotten MongoDB installed

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,030
on our Windows machine.

112
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,710
Now, if you Control
C out of this,

113
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,750
then MongoD will no
longer be running,

114
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,280
and you will no longer be able
to store data or read data

115
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,177
from the database.

116
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:51,510
Now you can obviously run it
as a service if you'd like,

117
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,759
and there's supposed to be
instructions for doing that

118
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,970
on the web and our manual.

119
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,020
But for this course, we often
run it from the command line.

120
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,070
And it's more convenient.

121
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,611
And it kind of gives
us a better feel

122
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:01,470
for what's going on
with the database.

123
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:01,970
All right.

124
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,650
So that's how you get
MongoDB running on Windows.
