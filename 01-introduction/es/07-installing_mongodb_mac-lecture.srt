1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,000
All right.

3
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,522
Now I'm going to show you
how to install MongoDB.

4
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:04,980
This video is going
to show you how

5
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,820
to install MongoDB on a Mac.

6
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,630
In the next video, we'll show
you how to install it on a PC.

7
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,440
If you're a Mac user,
watch this video.

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,970
If you're a PC user,
watch the next one.

9
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,660
So the first step is to
find the download page.

10
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,120
I'm going to do
that using Google.

11
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,110
I'm going to type
in, download MongoDB.

12
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,779
And when I do that, I get an ad.

13
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,320
And then after that, I get the
first organic link right here,

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,530
download MongoDB.

15
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,350
And I'm going to click on that.

16
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,090
OK.

17
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,300
So we come to this
page, and we can

18
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,091
see that the first
thing that we're offered

19
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:35,124
is MMS, which stands for the
MongoDB Management Service.

20
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:36,790
Now that's a cloud
service, and it's not

21
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,540
the way we're going
to run MongoDB today.

22
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,040
We're actually going to install
and run it on our computer.

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,610
Now if we look down, it offers
us the most recent release.

24
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,510
This course is going to cover
MongoDB 3.0, which is the most

25
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,200
recent release of MongoDB.

26
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,400
It was released only weeks ago
at the time of this recording.

27
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,160
And you should download whatever
is the most recent production

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,930
version when you hit this page.

29
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,810
It may not be 3.0.0 by the
time you get there, but 3.0.

30
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,130
something is what you want.

31
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,519
And since we're on a Mac,
it's already defaulted us

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,630
to the Mac download.

33
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,860
And I'm going to click
this Download link to get

34
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,660
this tarball onto my computer.

35
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,510
Now let's go to a terminal shell
and figure out where it is.

36
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,120
So I know it puts these
things in /downloads,

37
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,740
so I'm in the
downloads directory.

38
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,830
For those who aren't
sure how to get there,

39
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,571
I'll show you how to do that.

40
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:23,070
All right.

41
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,860
So there it is in the
downloads directory.

42
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,010
I'm going to un-tar it by
using the tar command, xvf

43
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,150
mongodb-osx et cetera.

44
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,190
That's going to
expand the tarball.

45
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,890
I'm going to enter the
directory, look around.

46
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,830
I see a readme file, the
license, and a bin directory.

47
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,107
I'm going to go in
the bin directory.

48
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:41,440
Let's see what there is in here.

49
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,937
Well, in here, we have a
bunch of different programs,

50
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,270
but the ones of greatest
interest to us right the second

51
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,130
are mango, which
is the Mongo shell

52
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,930
program lets us connect to
the database, and mongod,

53
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,590
which is the actual server.

54
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,590
And it's the server that
we want to get running.

55
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,780
Now the server is going to
put its data in /data/db

56
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,130
by default, so we need
to create that directory.

57
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,590
Now to do that, I'm going
to need to become root,

58
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,870
so let me do that.

59
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,120
So now I'm root.

60
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,470
And now I'm going to make
dir/data/db like that.

61
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,710
So now that there's
a data/db directory--

62
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,730
and we're just running
in development.

63
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,146
And I'm going to
keep this simple,

64
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:21,690
so I'm going to actually
chmod those directories

65
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,990
777 so that I can exit root and
write to them from my account.

66
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,460
And let's just confirm
that /data/db is 777.

67
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,630
And we can see that it is 777.

68
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,120
It's world writeable.

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,130
So I'm going to
exit the root shell.

70
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,340
All right.

71
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,850
So now we're going to
get mongod running.

72
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,920
I'm going to start
it running as myself.

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,730
Who am I?

74
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,930
I'm aje.

75
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,740
I'm going to run it right here
in this directory by typing

76
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,244
./mongod.

77
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,160
This will guarantee that
I take the executable

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,580
from the current
directory and not

79
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,246
from somewhere else
in my path because I

80
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:57,590
want to make sure I get
the one I just downloaded.

81
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,530
And I do that, and a whole
bunch of stuff prints out.

82
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,000
And see here, it's
listening on port.

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,980
By default, it listens
on the port 27017.

84
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,050
And you can see here it says
it's listening on port 27017.

85
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,940
Let's get a new terminal window.

86
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,720
And let's see what
my directory is.

87
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,960
It's downloads/mongodb bin.

88
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,890
Good.

89
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,251
And now let's run
the Mongo shell.

90
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:19,750
All right.

91
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,510
So I connected to
the Mongo shell,

92
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,060
and now I'm going
to insert something

93
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,720
into a names collection.

94
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,950
I'm going to insert a
document with my name

95
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,120
in it, so db.names.insert.

96
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,670
I'm going to test database.

97
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,790
There is one key name with
a value Andrew Erlichson.

98
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,650
Hit Return.

99
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,620
It inserted the document.

100
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,450
And at this point,
if I do a find,

101
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,230
I can see there's the document.

102
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:42,730
All right.

103
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,437
So I'm pretty much
done, but just

104
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,020
to make this work a
little bit better,

105
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,920
what I'm going to
do is I'm going

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,536
to kill the server by
hitting Control-C. I'm

107
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:52,490
going to become root again.

108
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,780
Now I'm root.

109
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,770
And now I'm in
the bin directory.

110
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,780
I'm just going to copy all these
programs to usr/local/bin just

111
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,330
like that.

112
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,640
And then, I'm going to
exit this root shell.

113
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,390
And then, I'm going
to type which mongo.

114
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,400
And I get the one
at usr/local/bin,

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,360
so that means that
usr/local/bin was already

116
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,080
in my path, which is great.

117
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,554
And so at this point,
mongod is running.

118
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,970
And I go back to
my home directory

119
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,940
if I ever want to do that.

120
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,260
And if I type mongod, it will
start the server running again.

121
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,860
And now, if I go to another
shell, I can connect to it.

122
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,320
So that's all there is to it.

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,532
And now, I have MongoDB running
on my computer in the simplest

124
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:30,490
possible configuration.

125
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,460
This is a standalone,
not a replica set,

126
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,750
and not necessarily running
with the same parameters

127
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,030
and the same configuration
you'd want in production,

128
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,720
but a fine configuration for
our purposes for development.

129
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,270
OK.
