1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,860
We are well on our way to
building our first web-based

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,250
application backed by MongoDB.

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,700
Let's go over how this
is going to work.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,580
We've already installed
MongoDB.

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,570
And it is running as a MongoD
process on our computer.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,100
And we want to write a
Python application.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,020
And this application, which is
written in Python, is going to

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,390
use the Bottle framework which
is going to allow it to take

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,470
HTTP requests from the
outside world, homes

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,180
all across the world.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,670
And your Python program, in
order to speak to MongoDB,

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,460
needs some sort of driver.

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,510
And that driver is
called PyMongo.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,250
And from there, it would allow
your application to speak via

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,880
BSON to the MongoD process.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,590
Now I'm going to go over how to
install PyMongo on a Mac.

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,580
And then we'll go and show
you how to do it on a PC.

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,990
But it's pretty similar.

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,910
And then after that, in a later
lesson, we'll show you

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,970
how to integrate the
Bottle piece.

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,510
So let's get started.

23
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,260
You need to download
the driver.

24
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,870
A good place to start for any
of the MongoDB drivers is at

25
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,520
api.mongodb.org.

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,190
And that's where I started.

27
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,230
Let me show you what it looks
like when you get there.

28
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,570
And then you can see
it has all these

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,000
different languages listed.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,670
And I'm going to click
on Python.

31
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,200
And the current version
as of the time of this

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,280
recording is 2.5.

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,550
And I'm going to click on
installing an upgrade.

34
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,360
And it makes a suggestion that
if you're using a Windows

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,790
machine, use the pre-packaged
installer.

36
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,780
But on a Mac or other Unix
machines, you can use pip to

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,010
install it using pip
install pymongo.

38
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,330
And that's what we're
going to do.

39
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,000
Now when I first did
this, I didn't

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
actually have pip installed.

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,980
And I used easy install.

42
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,660
I think the command was easy
install, install pip, to get

43
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,700
pip installed.

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,030
But once pip was installed, you
can just give the command

45
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,160
pip install pymongo, which
you'll need to do as root.

46
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's go through this.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,120
So who am I?

48
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,750
I am not root.

49
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,560
So I'm going to become root.

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,190
And now I have root
in the computer.

51
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,420
And now I'm going to do
pip install pymongo.

52
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,010
And what that's going to do is
going to reach out on the web

53
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,910
and download and compile
anything it says needed.

54
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,090
And then it did that.

55
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,730
And now it's installed.

56
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,460
Now to test it, I've written
a small program.

57
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,765
Notice I exited from
being root.

58
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:23,150
I no longer need to be root.

59
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,830
I wrote a small Python
program,

60
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,020
pymongo_getting_started.py.

61
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,560
And we're going to go over
that line by line to

62
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,740
understand how it works.

63
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,670
So the first thing it does
is it imports PyMongo.

64
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,070
And from PyMongo, it
imports the Mongo

65
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,140
client connection class.

66
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,170
Then it makes a connection using
Mongo client to local

67
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,510
host at port 27017, which
is the default

68
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,800
port for the database.

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,890
Then it connects to the test
database and to the names

70
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,420
collection.

71
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,400
Now you may recall in an earlier
lesson that I inserted

72
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,860
my name into the names
collection.

73
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,730
And actually, I edited
that out to be

74
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,390
Richard's name off camera.

75
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,750
And we'll be able to pull
a name out of that.

76
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,970
So let's see how that works.

77
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,860
We didn't need to do a find
in the collection.

78
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,490
So we do a find_one, which
finds one document in the

79
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,955
names collection, puts it
into this item variable.

80
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:16,990
It'll the wind up being
a Python dictionary.

81
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,250
And then we just
print that out.

82
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,720
And that's the entire program.

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,310
So let's just go
through there.

84
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,500
And let's run it by
calling Python,

85
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,630
pymongo_getting_started.

86
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,150
Let's see what we get.

87
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,210
And we get Richard.

88
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,580
And just to review again, what
we've done here is we've

89
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,990
installed the PyMongo
piece of the puzzle.

90
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,140
And we have Bottle installed.

91
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,450
But we haven't shown you how
to integrate Bottle and

92
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:37,820
PyMongo yet.

93
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,500
And we'll get to that soon.

94
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,930
But after this step, you should
have PyMongo installed

95
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,990
on your computer, if
you're a Unix user.

96
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,240
For Windows users, we have
a separate lesson

97
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,490
on installing PyMongo.

98
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,490
