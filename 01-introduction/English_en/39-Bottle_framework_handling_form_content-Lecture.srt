1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,250

2
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,650
OK, now we're going to talk
about how you handle form

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,200
inputs in the Bottle
in Python.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,580
Now this is not a full course
in web design, and we're not

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,590
going to be testing you heavily
on whether or not you

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,370
understand this stuff.

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,960
And we're going to give you a
lot of the code and tell you

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,540
how it works.

9
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,670
And again, this material is
somewhat optional, but I just

10
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,760
want to give you a basic
understanding of it so that

11
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,930
you aren't seeing it for the
first time in some of the

12
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,370
assignments down the
road in the class.

13
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,500
So when you do get to a page,
in a web page, for instance,

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,240
an index page, then it will
produce the content.

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,800
In this case, we're going to
have a little form on the page

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,610
itself using the form tag.

17
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,570
And then we're going to specify
that, on that page,

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,780
the response get posted
to a post handler at

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,210
favorite_fruit, and you'll
understand why in a second.

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,900
And that generates some code,
which then produces some

21
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,300
output HTML.

22
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,330
So that's the basic flow of how
you handle form inputs in

23
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,300
Python in Bottle.

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,260
And let's take a look
at an example.

25
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,190
So, I'm going to run
this small Python

26
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,210
script that I wrote.

27
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,600
And go to the home page for
the web server on 8080.

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,850
You can see it says Welcome
Richard, and it says that

29
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,090
there's apple, orange,
banana, and peach.

30
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,470
What is your favorite fruit?

31
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,200
And then if you type in peach
and submit it, it says, oh,

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,920
your favorite fruit is peach.

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,580
So how do we make that work?

34
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,690
Pretty straightforward.

35
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,700
Here is the code.

36
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,830
This is the fruit
form.py program.

37
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,040
This is the home page at the
route slash, sets up that list

38
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,210
again, and returns that same
template we saw before where

39
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,880
it sets username to Richard
and things to mythings.

40
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,300
And I'll show you
that template.

41
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,640
Here's that template
right now.

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,410
You can see that this template
prints out, the title is Hello

43
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,790
World, it says Welcome to the
person, it iterates through

44
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,960
the list of things,
printing each one

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,210
out as a list element.

46
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,750
And then here's the new part.

47
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,850
There's now a form within
the template.

48
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,660
And the form has an action of
slash favorite_fruit, which

49
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,950
means that the web browser will
submit your answer to the

50
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,240
favorite fruit URL.

51
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,480
And the method is
post, not get.

52
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,020
It asks if your favorite fruit,
oh, I see that guy

53
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,220
there, we'll just
correct that.

54
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,800
That's what is your
favorite fruit.

55
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
There we go.

56
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,700
And its got two HTML form
elements on it.

57
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,200
The first one is a text box
with name fruit, size 40.

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,020
Value is blank at
the beginning.

59
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,500
And then underneath it, there's
a submit button.

60
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,400
And then the form ends,
and the body of the

61
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,550
HTML document ends.

62
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,930
And then finally the
HTML itself ends.

63
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,990
So that's it.

64
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,400
And then you can see right
here that there's a new

65
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,000
handler defined, which we
haven't talked about before.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
It is a post handler.

67
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,950
So a post handler takes a post
request versus a get request,

68
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,690
and this post request is
at URL favorite_fruit.

69
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,980
And defines a function called
favorite_fruit.

70
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,330
And it has to get the form
element, which it does by

71
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,060
calling
bottle.request.forms.get.fruit,

72
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,440
quotes around the string
its looking for.

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,180
That gets the form element
that was named

74
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,600
fruit on the form.

75
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,070
If it's not set, it just sets
it to no fruit selected.

76
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,210
And then it returns this other
template called fruit

77
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,510
selection template, with
fruit set to fruit.

78
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,010
The fruit string set to the
fruit inside they dictionary

79
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,270
it passes the template.

80
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,510
So we just need to look at that
fruit selection template.

81
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,230
That fruit selection temple
is very simple.

82
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,450
It just says fruit selection
confirmation.

83
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,670
And then it says your favorite
fruit is, and it says fruit

84
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,520
right here.

85
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,910
And these curly braces surround
a piece of Python

86
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,950
code, in this case, the fruit
variable that was passed in.

87
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,600
So that might be a lot to take
on at one time, but if you

88
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,210
know anything about web
programming, you know how this

89
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,000
stuff works.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,280
It's fairly straightforward.

91
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,540
And again, for this class,
you're not really need to

92
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,790
understand this because
we're going to give

93
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,800
you most of the GUI.

94
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,380
We'll mostly focus on the
MongoDB parts of it.

95
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,510
But I wanted to make this course
complete so that you

96
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,760
guys could understand what we're
talking about with this

97
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,760
user interface for the blogging
system that we're

98
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,010
going to create in MongoDB.

99
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,850
