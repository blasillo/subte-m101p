1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,800
OK.

3
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,900
So it turns out that it
just prints out eight.

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,520
And the reason is that this for
loop iterates through all

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,610
the numbers here.

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,740
It does sum the numbers, but
it doesn't print the sum.

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,800
It prints the final value
of I, which is eight.

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,050
So it prints out eight.

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,950
