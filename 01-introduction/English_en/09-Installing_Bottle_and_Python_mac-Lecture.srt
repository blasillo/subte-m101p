1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,290

2
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,770
In this class, we're
going to build a

3
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,160
blog backed by MongoDB.

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,190
And that's going to be a web
application, and we're going

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,900
to do it using Python.

6
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,630
We need a web framework to do
this in, and one of the

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,620
simplest web frameworks out
there, which I like because it

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,590
is pretty simple and

9
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,780
straightforward, is called Bottle.

10
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,640
And Bottle is basically one
Python file that can run a web

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,445
server and let you take requests
at certain URLs and

12
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:29,120
do basic form processing, get
some templates for returning

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,580
information to the user.

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,020
So let's go through and
take a look at that.

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,400
You can go to
bottle.py.org/doc/dev and you

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,000
can see that it talks about
Bottle and how it works and

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,930
what its features are.

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,330
And we're not going to get too
much into that in this course.

19
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,130
We're going to give you a lot
of the code and we're not

20
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,740
going to heavily test
you on that.

21
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,200
But you can see, they have a
listed Hello World program,

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,410
and they also have a suggestion
that you use easy

23
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,900
install to install Bottle.

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,410
So I am going to try that,
and we're going to

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,150
see how that goes.

26
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,019
So here I am in my window, and
I'm going to run easy_install.

27
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,390
Actually, I'm already in root,
which I know you need to be to

28
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,080
make this work, and I'm going
to run easy_install.

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,110
And let's see, it seems
to have worked.

30
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,640
So if that's true, then I should
be able to run their

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Hello World program.

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,900
Let's see if that works.

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,570
So you can use any text
editor you want.

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,660
I'm most comfortable
with Emacs.

35
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,480
What I've done here is, I've
copied the Hello World program

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,545
into my text window.

37
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:30,130
And it's pretty straightforward.

38
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,130
We'll see what it does.

39
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,970
Basically, it looks like it
creates a route, which is a

40
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,110
URL that's going to watch at
/hello/name, where it will

41
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,290
find that name from the URL,
and it will print out a web

42
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,380
page with hello your name.

43
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,480
And it runs it at port 8080.

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,210
So that's the entire program.

45
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,350
So let's see if that works.

46
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,510
So we'll go into the terminal
window, and we'll go into our

47
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,450
program and we'll
run Hello World.

48
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,930
It says it's listening
on port 8080.

49
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,040
So we're going to go into our
web browser and we're going to

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,560
go to URL /hello/name and
see if that works.

51
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,220
So here we go; hello Andrew.

52
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,100
And here we go; hello
Bob, hello

53
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,560
Richard, and hello Dwight.

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,510
So that works.

55
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,770
And you're welcome to
try to get this

56
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,280
running on your own computer.

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,010
You're going to have to that
for your first homework

58
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,650
assignment.

59
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,870
But again, this is a basic
Python program that imports

60
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,485
certain methods from
the module Bottle.

61
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,590
It imports the route method,
the run method,

62
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,920
the temporal method.

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,625
It creates a route, which means
it's a URL path that

64
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:46,290
it's going to listen on and
answer requests for.

65
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,040
In this case, it's dynamic
ones, so it teaches us

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,470
something about dynamic URLs,
that it can take requests for

67
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,530
/hello/ any string name and then
it will return an HTML

68
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,380
document with your name in it.

69
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,740
So that's the way Bottle works.

70
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,990
