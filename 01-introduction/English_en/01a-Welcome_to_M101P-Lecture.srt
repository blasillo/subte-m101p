00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,590
Welcome to 101 MongoDB
for Developers.

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,025
My name is Andrew Erlichson.

4
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:08,600
This is the first
day of class.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,150
This is going to be a seven
week class on MongoDB

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,270
development.

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,290
So we're going to be talking
about all things MongoDB from

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,165
a developer standpoint.

9
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:22,190
In this class, we're going
to write a blog.

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,950
We're going to give you most
of the code for that.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,450
You're going to be doing a bunch
of small parts of it

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,390
attaching it to MongoDB.

13
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,820
Most folks are familiar
with the blog.

14
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,070
And we're going to have you
write that code, and it's

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,300
going to be Python code.

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,630
Python is not a requirement
for this course.

17
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,900
If you've never used Python
before, that's OK.

18
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,230
We're going to give you
most of the code.

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,400
We're going to teach you some
of the basics of Python.

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,730
I guess what probably is a
requirement is that you have

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,870
some experience with some other

22
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,655
high-level programming language.

23
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:52,890
So let's go over some of
the course logistics.

24
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,310
There are going to be video
lectures, much like this one,

25
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,540
and you can watch those
whenever you want.

26
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,272
They're on YouTube.

27
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:04,269
And we're going to probably
release them on Mondays and

28
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,020
then is about two hours
a week of material.

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,510
At the end of every video
lecture, there is going to be

30
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,870
a quiz, well not every one
but a lot of them have

31
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,900
quizzes at the end.

32
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,090
And those are just little
learning checks so that you

33
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,070
can make sure that you
understand the material.

34
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,110
Each week we're going to have a
homework assignment for each

35
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,180
of the seven weeks.

36
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,410
Now, the homework assignments
are going to be a combination

37
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,350
of questions in using the
quizzing engine and also

38
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,810
assignments where you have to
run MongoDB locally on your

39
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,070
computer and download some code,
modify it, maybe write

40
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,280
some queries, maybe write some
code in Python to do some

41
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,710
queries, pretty straightforward
if we ask you

42
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,240
to do that.

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,220
You'll be able to use whatever
language you want for these

44
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,080
assignments, not necessarily in
Python, because we won't be

45
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,980
checking the Python, itself.

46
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,755
We'll be checking the results.

47
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:55,810
And then, the final part of
the course is a final exam

48
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,160
that is like a long homework
assignment.

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,830
It's going to be during the last
week of class, during the

50
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,715
seventh week when there isn't
going to be any homework.

51
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:05,880
So let's talk about the
scoring in the class.

52
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,200
Now, video lectures count
for 0% of your grade.

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,090
So you don't actually need to
watch them, but we think you

54
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,165
should, because that's the
whole idea of the class.

55
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:18,160
And then, quizzes are not going
to count in your grade.

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,825
They're just for your
own learning,

57
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:21,430
because they don't count.

58
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,980
The homeworks are going to count
for 50% of your grade,

59
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,656
and the final exam will count
for 50% of your grade.

60
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:34,250
Now, in addition, we're going
to drop the lowest homework.

61
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,625
So each week, you have a
homework assignment.

62
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,190
And we're going to look at those
weeks and the one where

63
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,170
you have the lowest score,
we'll drop that out.

64
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,830
For students that get a 65% or
better in the class, we are

65
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,795
going to offer a certificate of
completion from 10gen that

66
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,700
you successfully completed the
MongoDB for Developers course.

67
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,560
It'll look a lot better
than this.

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,810
It'll be a PDF file with some
validation information so that

69
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,475
you can prove that it's real.

70
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,860
And you'll probably get that a
week or two after the course

71
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,155
is completed.

72
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:06,470
All right.

73
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,510
So let's do our first quiz.

74
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,840
What counts toward your final
grade in this class, quizzes,

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,730
homeworks, final exam, or
class participation?

76
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,980
Check all that apply.

77
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,870
