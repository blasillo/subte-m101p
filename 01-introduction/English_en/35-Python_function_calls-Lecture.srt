1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,760
OK, let's go over functions
in Python and

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,710
how to define a function.

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,260
So here's a small snippet of
code that defines a function.

5
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,470
You can see that every function
in Python starts with

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,780
the word def.

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,736
And then you have the function
name followed by parentheses

8
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:17,270
and any arguments you want
passed to the function.

9
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,710
And then there's a colon.

10
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,440
So in this case, I've actually
created a function that

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,060
analyzes a little list.

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,840
I have a list here that's got
some fruit in it, apple,

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,510
orange, grape, kiwi,
orange, apple.

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,570
You can see there are
some repeated items.

15
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,250
And I want to analyze how
many times each item

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,590
appears in this list.

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,270
So to do that, I'm going to
initialize a dictionary inside

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,830
this function as an
empty dictionary.

19
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,430
And then have a look at
each item in my list.

20
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,520
And then I'm going to increment
a counter inside the

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,850
dictionary for the key using the
item in the list as a key

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,920
into the dictionary, into
the hash table.

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,210
I'm just to increment it by one
and then at the end I'm

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,960
going to return the dictionary
and then we can print it out.

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,540
So here's the main
body of the code.

26
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,480
It calls analyze list with the
argument being this list of

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,890
fruit and then prints out the
resulting dictionary.

28
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,370
Let's see what happens
when we run this.

29
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,610
All right, so when we run
this, we get an error.

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,150
So why is that?

31
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,570
It says here that key
apple is undefined.

32
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,550
So let's look back at our code
and try to figure out where we

33
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,680
get that error.

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,530
So it turns out that the issue
is, you can't access an item

35
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,790
from a dictionary prior
to setting it.

36
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,710
And the first time we find an
item in the list like apple,

37
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,470
and then we try to set count
of apple equal to count of

38
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,450
apple plus 1, we are
dereferencing something that

39
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,700
is undefined.

40
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,210
So how do we fix this?

41
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,240
Pretty straightforward.

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,360
We check to see if it's
in there or not.

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,670
So if item in counts, then
we can increment by one.

44
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,180
Else, we're going to set
it equal to one.

45
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,210
And that should fix it.

46
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,460
Let's see if it does.

47
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,330
I've saved it.

48
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,530
Go to that window.

49
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,570
And run it once again.

50
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,510
And this time it completes and
it prints out the resulting

51
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,250
dictionary.

52
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,340
It says that orange appears
twice, kiwi once, grape once,

53
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,240
and apple twice.

54
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,720
And if we look back at our code,
you can see that orange

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,264
does appear twice, and apple
appears twice, and grape

56
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:11,090
appears once, and kiwi
appears once.

57
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,070
So it looks correct to me.

58
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,540
And that's how you define a
function inside Python.

59
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,790
