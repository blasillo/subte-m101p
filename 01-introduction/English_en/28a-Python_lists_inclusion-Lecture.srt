1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,250

2
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,060
Next, I'd like to show you how
you check whether a particular

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,390
item is in a list.

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,710
Let's say that we have a
list of three fruits.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,020
A equals apple, pear, orange.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,360
We want to know whether or not
pear appears in the list.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,230
We can use the in operator.

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,820
Pear in a.

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,650
That evaluates to true.

10
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,530
How about grape?

11
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,480
Grape in a, evaluates
to false.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,080
And then I'll teach you the
conditional statement to test

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,540
this, since you normally
won't be in the shell.

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,540
You could say, if pear
in a, colon--

15
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,590
there's a colon required at the
end of the if statement.

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,140
And so here's our conditional
statement, pear in a, and then

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,540
the colon at the end,
I'm going to indent,

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,690
print, there is a pear.

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,440
And the statement, and then it
prints, there is a pear,

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,770
because there was a pear.

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,400
And if we do that exact same
test, but with a fruit that

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,420
was not in there,
like a grape, if

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,390
grape in a, then print.

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,430
There is a grape.

25
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,750
It prints nothing because
there is no grape.

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,117
This is very useful when you get
data back from Mongo and

27
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:02,650
it's in an array, and you want
to check whether a particular

28
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,670
item is in the structure,
you can use the in

29
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,670
operator to do it.

30
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,840
Here's the quiz.

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,560
Let's talk about Python lists
and checking for inclusion.

32
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,830
Given a Python list called
fruit, write an if statement

33
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,530
to check whether apple
is in the list.

34
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,780
Type your answer right here.

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,840
