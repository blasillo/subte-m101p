1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,400
And the answer is
that MongoDB is

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,950
document-oriented, as we've shown.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,650
It does not support joins,
because joins are not

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,480
horizontally scalable.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,510
It is schemaless.

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,990
And technically, is it
really schemaless?

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,790
Each document can have
its own schema.

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,630
There are indexes that you
can associate with each

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,270
collection, which is
a form of schema.

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,040
But we call it schemaless.

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,920
The schema is, I would say,
flexible, and the schema is

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
not documented for a particular
collection.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,250
And then finally, MongoDB
supports SQL.

15
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,350
MongoDB does not support SQL,
and that is specifically

16
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,100
missing in the product.

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,080
It would be difficult to support
SQL with all of the

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,380
sub-documents and sub-arrays
that are offered within the

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,540
document-oriented model.

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,790
All right, so that's
the answer.

21
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,750
