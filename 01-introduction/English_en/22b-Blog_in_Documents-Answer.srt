00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,160

00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,120
OK, and the answer is 1.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,560
All the information we need to
display the homepage of this

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,930
blog is contained in the
posts collection.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,120
We don't need the author's
collection because we have the

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,830
author name in the post
collection directly.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,080
