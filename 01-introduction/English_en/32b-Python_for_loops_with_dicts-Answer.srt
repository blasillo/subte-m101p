prints red, because it

00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,670
iterates through
the keys, name,

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,170
hometown, favorite color.

6
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,020
It checks when item is equal to
favorite color, and then it

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,000
prints people of item, which is
printing people of favorite

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,570
color, which is red.

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,820
