1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,330
The goal of this homework was
to make sure that you got

3
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,390
PyMongo and Bottle installed
and that that

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,850
would all run for you.

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,760
So we gave you a program that
you needed to run from the

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,930
command line hw1-3.py,
which starts up a web

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,000
server on port 8080.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,810
And then we asked you to
go to a particular URL.

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,510
And I'll show you that URL.

10
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,060
And the URL we asked you
to go to was hw1/50.

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,530
And if you did that, it would
print out the value of 53.

12
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,580
And that was the answer
to the assignment.

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,290
If we look at the program--

14
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,870
we'll take a quick look at this
program-- it uses some

15
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,090
things that are not yet
covered in the course.

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,250
And the program was supposed
to be a little bit more

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,260
complicated so that it would be
hard for you to run without

18
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,660
actually getting it running--

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,030
hard for you to run from the
command line, that is.

20
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,010
But it's not that hard
to understand it.

21
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,960
You can see that the first
thing it does--

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,760
it has a function
called get_hw1.

23
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,440
And it's decorated with this
decorator calling into the

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,450
Bottle package, basically,
saying that if you go to this

25
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,450
/hw1 URL with any sort of string
appended at the end,

26
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,160
that it will run this function
and hand you the

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,910
n value as an integer.

28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,300
And it makes an int out of that
string and connects to

29
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,520
the funny numbers collection
in the m101 database.

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,820
And then it does a skip and a
limit to skip the first n

31
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,520
value, skip the next value,
and then print that

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,980
out to the web page.

33
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,660
So basically, when you ask for
the 53rd element, it's saying,

34
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,520
skip 53 of them and limit 1.

35
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,550
So I guess you're getting the
54th element at that point.

36
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,200
And then at the very end of the
program, it runs Bottle in

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,380
debug mode and runs it on local
host and port 8080.

38
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,790
And that is what this
program is doing.

39
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,040
