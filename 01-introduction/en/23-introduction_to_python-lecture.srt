1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,990
All right, so we're going to
use Python in this class to

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,770
build a blog.

4
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,230
And that you can use whatever
language you want, but Python

5
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,890
is going to be the language we
use for all the example code.

6
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,000
And it's going to be the one
we go into most deeply in

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,110
terms of drivers.

8
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,890
So if you know Python,
that's great.

9
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,840
You can skip this part.

10
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,020
It's completely optional.

11
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,150
If you don't know Python, then
we're going to do a small

12
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,120
tutorial on Python in the
next few lessons.

13
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,640
You can learn it, or there are
lots of resources online to

14
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,520
learn Python.

15
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,870
But this should be enough to get
you started and using the

16
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,400
language if you're an
experienced programmer in any

17
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,490
other language.

18
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,759
So Python is a scripting
language.

19
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,450
It was created by Guido
Von Rossum.

20
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,870
It is named after Monty Python's
Flying Circus.

21
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,280
It strives to be readable.

22
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,200
And I think it is actually quite
readable compared to a

23
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,740
lot of other languages.

24
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,500
It is garbage collected, which
means you do not need to worry

25
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,290
about managing your own
memory, which is nice.

26
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,010
And it is dynamically typed.

27
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,260
And there's a bunch of other
features and aspects of

28
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,140
Python, but we won't go into
them right this second.

29
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,300
Also, just generally speaking,
if your experienced with Perl,

30
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,350
Perl sort of believed that there
was always more than one

31
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,440
way to do everything.

32
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,970
And Python looks more toward
creating idioms to do things

33
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,020
in a standard way so that
the code is readable and

34
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,390
understandable by
someone else.

35
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,810
So let's get started.

36
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,220
The first thing we're going
to do is run the Python

37
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,080
interpreter interactively.

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,420
And normally, you're going to
create a Python script and

39
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,760
you're going to edit it
with a text editor.

40
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,620
And then you'll run it.

41
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,770
But in this case, for this
lesson, we're actually going

42
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,980
to run interactively.

43
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,390
So I started the Python
interpreter by typing Python.

44
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,980
And then I'm going to use
the print command to

45
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,820
print Hello, world!

46
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,290
And you can see how
that works.

47
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,770
And you can see that strings
in Python are represented

48
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,140
within double quotes.

49
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,610
If you want to concatenate two
strings, you can do that using

50
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,860
the plus operator.

51
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,910
So Hello Dwight.

52
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,520
And you can do this using
multiple strings.

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,770
You can see how this puts some
spaces in to make this a

54
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,390
little bit more readable.

55
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,780
Print Hello Dwight
and Richard.

56
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,330
That's the first lesson.

57
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,770
Here's the quiz.

58
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,390
Right an expression to
concatenate two strings, hat

59
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,830
and pin, in Python, to
the string hatpin.

60
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,160
And we're just looking through
the expression here, so no

61
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,930
assignment to a variable
or anything else.

62
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,180
