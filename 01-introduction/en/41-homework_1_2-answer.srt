1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,275

2
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:00,550
All right.

3
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,570
In this problem, you had to
restore the collection and

4
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,560
then run this program.

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,220
And the program is
Homework 1-2.py.

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,070
Let's run it together--

7
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,320
hw1-2.py.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,050

9
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,860
It prints out that the
answer is 1815.

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,140
Let's look at what that
program does.

11
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,680
We can see it makes a connection
using the Mongo

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,450
client class, connecting
to local hosts.

13
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,300
It then connects to the m101
database and the funny numbers

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,060
collection.

15
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,290
It then iterates through
that collection.

16
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,440
In each document, there
is a key called value.

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,540
And the value is retrieved.

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,520
And then we divide it by 3, by
calling mod 3, and find out

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,110
when the remainder is 0.

20
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,260
And then, for that item, we
can keep a running sum.

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,340
And at the end, it prints
out the answer.

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,590
And that's it.
