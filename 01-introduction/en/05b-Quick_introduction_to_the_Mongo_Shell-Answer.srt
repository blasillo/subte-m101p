1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,340

2
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,870
OK.

3
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,760
So of these four expressions,
only the first

4
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,360
one is valid JSON.

5
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,220
It's in the standard form with
the key, and then a colon,

6
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,910
then the value.

7
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,730
You notice for the second one
that there are commas between

8
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,460
the key and value.

9
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,350
That's illegal.

10
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,239
For this third one here, there
are semicolons separating the

11
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,790
pairs of keys and values.

12
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,070
That's not legal.

13
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,380
And in the third one,
there's actually a

14
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,380
couple things wrong.

15
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,090
But one is that it starts with
a regular rounded brace, and

16
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,420
then finishes with
a curly brace.

17
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,270
The whole thing needs to be in a
set of curly braces, and you

18
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,740
can see the separaters are also
wrong, and inconsistent

19
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,990
between the keys and value.

20
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,220
