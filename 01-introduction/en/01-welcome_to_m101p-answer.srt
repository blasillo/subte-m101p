1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,240
And the answer is that homeworks
and the final exam

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,800
count toward your final
grade in the class.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,600
Quizzes and class participation
do not.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,110
Now, class participation, there
really is no way to

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,450
participate directly during
the video lectures.

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,000
But we do have an online forum
that you can see in the

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,870
courseware.

9
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,520
And it is a very useful
way to get help with a

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,830
question you have.

11
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,810
Usually the student's answer
the questions much more

12
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,970
quickly than I do.

13
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,630
You'll often get an answer
within 15 or 20 minutes from

14
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,860
somebody out there.

15
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,070
And we also have some teaching
assistants that we've hired

16
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,800
for this term that could help
you out in the forums as well.

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,050
