00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,160

2
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,150
All right, let's revisit
JSON now and talk

3
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,400
about what it can represent.

4
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,560
And then we're going to get to
why it can represent it.

5
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,110
There are only two basic data
structures inside JSON, and

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,880
they are arrays and
dictionaries.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,370
Now, we all know what
arrays are.

8
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,400
Arrays are lists of things,
and dictionaries are these

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,930
associated maps.

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,790
So they can be combined
in arbitrary ways.

11
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,270
So an array inside JSON is
represented using these square

12
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,590
brackets and then a list
of items between.

13
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,980
And a dictionary is represented
using the curly

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,250
braces, and it's a bunch of
keyword and value pairs.

15
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,820
And then there's a keyword,
colon, and then a value.

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,350
And there could be arbitrary
numbers of these

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,950
separated by commas.

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,600
Those are the only two data
structures inside JSON, and

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,305
they're all just combined.

20
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:44,530
And they can be nested
in arbitrary ways.

21
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,990
So I can create a very
deep document.

22
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,020
So I can create a document,
for instance.

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,180
At the top level there has
to be a dictionary.

24
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,510
And I can create something
with a name,

25
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,930
and that has a value.

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,000
And then I could have a
city, and it can have

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,740
another value here.

28
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,880
And then I could put-- for
instance, if this is just a

29
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,030
collection of people and their
cities and maybe their

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,690
interests--

31
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,800
can have another key here
called interest.

32
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,110
And that could turn out
to be an array, and

33
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,200
it's got square brackets.

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,270
And then I could put
things in here.

35
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,410
And each of these in itself
could, of course, be its own

36
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,040
dictionary, which means it would
be represented using the

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,350
curly brace.

38
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,350
So we're going to build up
everything from these two

39
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,050
basic data structures.

40
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,700
The two basic data structures
are arrays and dictionaries.

41
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,380
Now we're going to go through
and show you each of these and

42
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,500
teach you how to write them.

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,530
And then we'll go from a higher
level and show how

44
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,870
they're used in data
representation relative to

45
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,230
relational databases.

46
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,410
All right, time for
the next quiz.

47
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,100
Write the JSON for a simple
document containing a single

48
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,370
key, fruit, that has as its
value an array containing

49
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,040
three strings, apple,
pear, and peach.

50
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,990
You're just going to write the
JSON document for that.

51
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,240
