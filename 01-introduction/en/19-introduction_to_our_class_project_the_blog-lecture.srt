1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,160

2
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,130
I want to circle back now and
show you the blog that we're

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,930
going to be building
in this class.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,020
So I've built most of it here,
and I'm going to take you

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,230
through it quickly.

6
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,290
I think most people know
what a blog is.

7
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,219
It's a long form format for
writing articles with titles.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,940
You can see here I've
copied some articles

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,270
from the 10gen blog.

10
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,630
And here, I'll click on one,
this "Free Online MongoDB

11
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,660
Classes."

12
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,840
And you can see that there's a
slug that is in the URL along

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,700
with a byline with my
name and a date.

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,450
And then at the bottom, you can
see the tags it was filed

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,500
underneath.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,080
And then there are some comments
by some readers, and

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,860
we can add another comment
right here.

18
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,670
After we add that comment, we
can submit it, and it'll be

19
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,280
part of the blog entry.

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,340
And then if we go here to the
Home on the blog, we'll see

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,160
all the articles again.

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,930
We can also add a new
entry into the blog.

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,930
I'm not going to add a new entry
right now, but this is

24
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,480
one of the pages that we'll be
implementing along with a

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,680
Sign-up page and
a Logout page.

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,860
So you'll be building this
yourself as well as extending

27
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,050
it, and we'll be showing you how
to build a schema for this

28
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,600
and helping you along with
writing the code.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,720
So this is the way it'll look
when it's all finished, but I

30
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,660
wanted to give you this
high-level view of it to sort

31
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,990
of concretely explain what we're
going to be using as a

32
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,350
vehicle for teaching
in the class.

33
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,600
