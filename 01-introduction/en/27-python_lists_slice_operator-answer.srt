1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,910
OK.

3
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,370
And the answer is things,
one colon three.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,820
Remember, they are numbered
from zero.

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,100
So zero, one, two, three.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,900
But doesn't include
the right item.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,480
So that gives you
the first two.

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,730
That's the answer.

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,280
