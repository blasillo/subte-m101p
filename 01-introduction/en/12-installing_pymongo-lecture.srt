1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,090

2
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,589
All right.

3
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:02,280
Let's talk about PyMongo.

4
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,930
PyMongo acts as the
glue that connects

5
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,480
your program to the database.

6
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,310
So you have some
application code, which

7
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,320
I'll represent by this
box right here, your app,

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,630
and in order to talk to
the database, MongoDB,

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,010
represented by this M, you
need something in the middle.

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,550
And that thing in the
middle is PyMongo.

11
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,530
So we need to install
PyMongo on your computer

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,280
so that you can talk to the
database from your application

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,510
program from Python.

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,270
Now to do that,
we're going to start

15
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,455
by going to api.mongodb.org.

16
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,980

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,480
Let's do that now.

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,616
So we start at
api.mongodb.org, and that's not

19
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:40,740
a particularly pretty page.

20
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,950
It's a pretty basic page.

21
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,910
It's an old page from the
early days of our ecosystem,

22
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,880
but it very cleanly
lists all the languages

23
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,090
that we support and gives you a
quick link to the documentation

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,640
and the install instructions
for the language.

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,720
In this class, we're
going to use Python,

26
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,079
so we're going to click
right here on Python.

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,370
And then, we're going to see
all the different versions

28
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,950
of the driver, the PyMongo
driver, that are offered.

29
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,070
Now we're going to use a beta
version of the PyMongo driver

30
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,310
in this class.

31
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,900
We're going to use the 3.0 beta.

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,590
Now this is not the
production version,

33
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,340
but it's the version
that will be released

34
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,360
in the next couple of weeks.

35
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,484
And by the time you watch
this, it may have already

36
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:18,070
been released, so
you may not see a B

37
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,760
after this when you go here.

38
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,220
But right now, if
you come to the page

39
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,780
at the time of this
recording, it's still in beta.

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,055
So we're going to install it.

41
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:27,680
We're going to go to
the documentation.

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,400
And once we do that, we're
going to look down this page.

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,460
There's a lot of information
here, by the way.

44
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,450
There's a quick start
guide that's fantastic.

45
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,080
There's all the
API documentation,

46
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,650
and I'm going to
show you that later.

47
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,810
But right now, let's focus on
the installing and upgrading

48
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,550
instructions.

49
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,020
I'll click right there.

50
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,605
And it says that to
install I can use pip, pip

51
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:48,320
install pymongo.

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Pip is an installer.

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,980
Now pip looks at PyPI
as a place to get

54
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,160
all of the distributions.

55
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,050
And unfortunately, since
the PyMongo driver is still

56
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,760
in beta right now, the 3.0
driver is still in beta,

57
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,620
if we typed pip install
pymongo at the command line,

58
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,310
we wouldn't get this version.

59
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,229
We would actually get
the released version.

60
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,090
So if we scroll down the
page, at the very bottom,

61
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,560
is some information for
installing the beta version.

62
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,190
So I'm going to make this
smaller so I can grab it.

63
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,200
All right.

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,640
Now I'm just going to
select this with my mouse.

65
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,150
I'm going to copy
that, and now I'm

66
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,780
going to bring that
to a command line.

67
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,790
So we go to the command
line, and we become root.

68
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,130
Now I'm root.

69
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,750
And now I'm going
to paste that down.

70
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,250
All right.

71
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,790
Let's paste that.

72
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,530
And now it's
running the install.

73
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,950
And now it's installed.

74
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,480
All right.

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,430
So now that it's
installed, we might

76
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,600
want to actually try
to write a small Python

77
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,030
program that uses the database.

78
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,140
So let's look at that.

79
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,700
So I have one of those
programs right here.

80
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,670
Let's look at it in editor.

81
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,360
So this is a very short program
that's going to use PyMongo

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,540
and it's going to read
something in the database.

83
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,510
And I'm going to
explain it line by line.

84
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,380
And then we're going
to test it out.

85
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,796
And we'll see if
it really worked.

86
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:59,670
So the first thing
we're going to do

87
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,610
is we're going to
import PyMongo.

88
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,200
This is a Python program.

89
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,450
And from PyMongo, we're
going to import MongoClient.

90
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,200
And that just makes
it a little bit easier

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,658
to use that symbol
so we don't have

92
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:11,050
to say pymongo.MongoClient.

93
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,920
Then we're going to
create a connection

94
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,400
using MongoClient to localhost
27017-- that's a default port.

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,110
We could omit that in this
case, and it would still work.

96
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,084
We're going to connect to
the database, test database.

97
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,250
Then we're going to connect
to the names collection,

98
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,230
names equals db.names.

99
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,000
And then we're going
to call find one

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,510
on the names collection.

101
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,740
And we're going to
print the value that

102
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,850
is kept for the name key.

103
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,854
So we have a document.

104
00:03:36,854 --> 00:03:38,520
And we're going to
look up the name key,

105
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,460
and print that what's in
there, and get the value out.

106
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,090
So let's try that out
and see what happens.

107
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,230
So to run this program, I invoke
Python from the command line.

108
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,010
And then python
pymongo_getting-started.py.

109
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,830
And I hit Return.

110
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,110
And it prints out
Andrew Erlichson,

111
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,890
which is exactly what we put
in earlier if you remember.

112
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:03,690
We can see this in Mongo, too,
that if we do db.names.find,

113
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,250
that we have one document
with name Andrew Erlichson.

114
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,450
And by the way, the reason
this worked-- and this

115
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,210
is an easy thing to
get tripped up on--

116
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,030
is that MongoD, the
database server,

117
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,500
is still running in this window.

118
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,010
So if MongoD is not running
in this window, it won't work,

119
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,010
and you'll get an error.

120
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,480
So let's say I killed it.

121
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,940
Now if I try to run my program,
now it's going to get an error.

122
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,400
And I'll show you
that in case you

123
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,360
see this error when you try.

124
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,200
All right.

125
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,070
Now I'm trying to
run the program here.

126
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,590
But now the database
is not running.

127
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,080
And so now, we're hanging
on the connect call

128
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,420
and waiting for the time out.

129
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,690
And you can see, after a period
of time, we get this timeout.

130
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,340
And we edited out
the wait, but you can

131
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,070
see it says Connection refused.

132
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,940
And if we just start the
database server up and running

133
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,510
and then run it,
then it works fine.

134
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,330
It prints out the one document
it found, which is my name.

135
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,090
All right.

136
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,910
So that's how you get
PyMongo installed.

137
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,050
This on a Mac.

138
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,100
However, installing it on a
PC is pretty much the same.

139
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,790
If you install Python on the
PC, you'll get setup tools.

140
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,420
And by changing your path
to include those scripts,

141
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,170
you can use pip, which
can install PyMongo.

142
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,820
Now as a reminder, we're using
the 3.0 version of PyMongo

143
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,110
driver in this class.

144
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,720
It's in beta right
now, so you may

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,920
need to use that special
pip install line.

146
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,050
But in a few weeks, it's
not going to be in beta,

147
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,630
and simply saying pip
install pymongo will work.

148
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,360
I won't enter it
here, but that is

149
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,930
all you need to install
it when it's out of beta.
