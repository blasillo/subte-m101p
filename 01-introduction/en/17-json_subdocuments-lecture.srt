1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,410
OK.

3
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,930
It's time for a quiz.

4
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,700
I'd like you to write a JSON
document with a single key,

5
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,160
address, that has as its value
another document with the keys

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,070
street address, city, state, and
zip code, in this order.

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,250
And those have the following
values--

8
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,900
23 Elm Drive.

9
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,200
City is Palo Alto.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,670
State is California.

11
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,830
Zip code is 94305.

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,620
So, once again, write a JSON
document with a single key,

13
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,710
address, that has as its
value another document.

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,430
And in that document there's
a street address, a city, a

15
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,100
state, and a zip code.

16
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,920
And then here we give you
the values for those.

17
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,170
