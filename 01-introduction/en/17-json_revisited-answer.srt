00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,230

2
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,890
OK, and the answer
is right here.

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,890
You open up the curly
brace, fruit.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,790
You can omit those quotes if you
want around the fruit key,

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,140
and then colon, and
then this array.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,290
Apple, pear, and peach.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,730
And you do need to have some
sort of quoting around these

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,470
values here, apple,
pear, and peach.

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,230
That's a JSON for
this document.

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,480
