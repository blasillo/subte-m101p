1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,995
OK, so we've shown you
a little bit about

3
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,600
what MongoDB is.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,810
And now I want to take you end
to end on building a small

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,280
application within MongoDB and
show you how that works.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,490
So first of all, you have the
MongoD process, and that's the

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,990
database server itself running
out of the box.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,020
In addition, you have
the Mongo shell.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,680
The Mongo shell, which I'll also
show you, connects the

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,190
MongoD and lets you
interact with it.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,130
Next-- and we're going to do
a lot of our programming in

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,620
Python in this class.

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,130
And in particular, we're going
to use bottle and PyMongo And

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,680
so you've got this world
of an HTTP server--

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,850
and remember, we're going to try
to build a little blog--

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,310
and within that, you'll be
running Python and the Python

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,320
interpreter.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,980
And within that, you can be
running this Bottle framework

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,670
along with PyMongo, which
we'll get to.

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,100
And Bottle and PyMongo
are going to let

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,390
you connect to MongoD.

22
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,130
And then over here,
inside a house

23
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,269
somewhere, you have a user.

24
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,490
And that user is sitting
on a computer--

25
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,760
this is my representation
of a laptop--

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,520
and that computer connected
over the

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,750
internet to your process.

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,570
And there might be some routers
here and Linksys boxes

29
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,620
and network address translation,
everything else.

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,560
But that's, broadly speaking,
how it works.

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,150
So to give you a flavor of
JavaScript Object Notation,

32
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,290
I'd like to show you the Mongo
shell and then just a few

33
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,570
documents getting inserted
into it.

34
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,450
We'll do that, and then we'll
go back to learning how to

35
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,640
install Mongo.

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,890
So let's do that.

37
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,140
