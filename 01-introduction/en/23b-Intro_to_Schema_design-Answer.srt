1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,200

2
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,880
All right.

3
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,030
So, turns out, that there's only
one of these four where

4
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,300
you have to use a separate
collection.

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,550
The first one is that the data
would be duplicated across

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,650
multiple objects within
the collection.

7
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,780
Now, this is not a reason why
you have to put the data in a

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,770
separate collection.

9
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,750
You might want you because you
don't want to go to the

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,350
trouble of changing it
everywhere in the source

11
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,120
documents, if a piece of data
changes in the sub-documents,

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,420
but it certainly isn't
a requirement.

13
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,460
You need an index on
the data element.

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,170
So know we support indexing
sub-documents, as well as

15
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,460
array elements, so there's no
problem with embedding data in

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,070
a document.

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,370
You can still index it.

18
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,360
And then finally, the data
is not isomorphic.

19
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,260
Well, I'm not sure exactly
what that means

20
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,220
here in this context--

21
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,430
I sort of made it up.

22
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,540
But no, it's not a reason.

23
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,650
Isomorphic means all the same
type, and you could, in fact,

24
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,600
put data in each document that
was a slightly different

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,020
type-- one was an array, and
one was an array plus a

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,850
sub-document, that
would be fine.

27
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,530
And there's no reason why you'd
have to put that to a

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,730
separate collection.

29
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,250
But this third one here is a
reason why you might have to

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,420
use a separate collection, which
is that if the embedded

31
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,810
data would exceed the 16
megabyte document limit,

32
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,500
within MongoDB, you have no
choice but to put that data in

33
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,540
its own collection and reference
it within the

34
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,600
primary collection using some
sort of identifier.

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,850
