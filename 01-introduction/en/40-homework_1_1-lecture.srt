1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,290
In this first homework, we're
going to have you install

3
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,790
MongoDB just like we showed
you in the lesson.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,540
You're going to install either
for PC or Mac depending on

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,060
what you're using at home.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,440
And we're going to have to use
the mongorestore command to

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,230
load up the database with some
files that have been exported

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,840
before using mongodump.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,440
And then we're going to also
have you connect with the

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,830
shell to the Mongo database and
use the findOne command to

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,340
look up a document in
the collection.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,070
So let's talk a little
bit about this

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,870
mongorestore command.

14
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,680
So most databases have a way to
get data in and out of the

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,220
database, and MongoDB
is no different.

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,460
And there's a mongodump and a
mongorestore command that you

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,320
can use to bring data in
and out of database.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,420
We've created some collections
and used mongodump to dump

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,340
them out, and you're going
to use mongorestore to

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,775
bring them back in.

21
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:02,060
Connecting with the mongo shell
is going to require you

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,990
to have Mongo installed and
running, of course.

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,930
You're going to use the M101
collection, which is going to

24
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,560
be restored by the mongorestore
command.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,635
And then finally, the findOne
command is on the mongo shell

26
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:20,560
db.homework.findone to find the
data element you need to

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
answer the quiz.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,630
All right so let's see
what that looks like.

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,140
I'm going to do it right here,
so you can see what it looks

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,765
like on a Mac.

31
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:32,170
I'm going to tar -xvf
homework1.tar.

32
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:32,890
I've done that.

33
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,530
You see it's created a dump
directory with M101 and some

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,050
of the data here from these
different collections.

35
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,785
And then there's two other files
you're going to need for

36
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:43,100
the other two homeworks.

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,960
So let's look at how we
get this data in.

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,860
So we run mongorestore right
here, and I just hit return.

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,220
And it connects to
the local MongoDB

40
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,420
server, which is running.

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,880
And you can see right here, it
creates some collections.

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,040
So it creates the M101 database,
and it creates a

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,510
funnynumbers collection and the
Homework One collection.

44
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,389
And if I then start Mongo and
use M101 and show the

45
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,730
collections, you can see that
there's a funnynumbers

46
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,240
collection an the Homework One
collection and some indexes.

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,050
So I'm not going to show you
what's in those collections,

48
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,080
because that's the assignments
for the homework--

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,940
to prove you're able to do it.

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,980
But if you have any questions,
just put your

51
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,970
questions in the forums.

52
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,320
I'm sure somebody else is
running into the same problems

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,990
as you are.

54
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,240
All right.
