1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,510
There are lots of operations
that you can do on a list.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,890
Let's go back to our example,
before, we looked at this

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,635
small list, which has apple,
pear, and banana in it.

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,550
And we've assigned it to a.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,720
So if we wanted to add another
item to that list, we could

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,540
use the append function.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,630
And we could append
a kiwi onto it.

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,410
And if we look at a now,
we'll see it's apple,

10
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,170
pear, banana, and kiwi.

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,990
If we wanted to change,
directly, one of the items in

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,895
the list, we could do that.

13
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:28,250
We could say a of 1 equals
grape, and they're

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,495
ordered from zero.

15
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,340
And now if we look at a,
we can see that it's

16
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,840
been changed to grape.

17
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,946
We can also remove an
item from the list

18
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:36,370
using the delete command.

19
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,490
We'll do a of 2, which
will be banana.

20
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,100
Now, if we look at a, we see
that banana is now missing.

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,120
It's apple, grape, and kiwi.

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,280
Now if you want to see all the
things are possible to do with

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,260
the list, you use a dir
command inside Python.

24
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,500
And it will look at the object
and tell you all the different

25
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,580
things that are possible.

26
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,620
I'm not going to go through
a lot of these.

27
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,530
They are internal commands
that we don't need to

28
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,500
understand.

29
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,170
But you can see there's
a pop, and there's a

30
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,520
remove, there's an extend.

31
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,600
You can look up the
documentation, but this dir

32
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,959
command is very useful,
especially inside the shell,

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,500
if you're trying to understand
what a method

34
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,170
can do inside Python.

35
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,410
I'll just quickly, briefly show
you the page here from

36
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,430
the Python docs, which shows
all the basic commands that

37
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,780
you can do, all the basic
functions and methods you can

38
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,060
call on the list--

39
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,150
append, extend, insert, remove,
pop, sort, reverse it.

40
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,070
And these are pretty
straightforward.

41
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,090
You probably won't use very
many of them when you're

42
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,060
working in this course.

43
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,080
But it's good to know
that they're

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,160
available if you need them.

45
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,230
Here's the quiz.

46
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,210
Manipulating a Python list.

47
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,630
Write the code to append
hammer onto

48
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,080
a list named things.

49
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,667
