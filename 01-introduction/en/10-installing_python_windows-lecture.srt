1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,800
Now that we have MongoDB
installed on our Windows

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,910
machine, next, we need to get
Python installed, because

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,700
we're going to use Python
in this class.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,690
You may already have
Python installed.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,210
And if you do have Python
installed, then that's great.

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,490
You don't need to install
it again.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,050
But if you don't, you'll
want to just Google

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,700
for download Python.

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,610
And then if you go to the first
link right here, you'll

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,890
see that it's this
python.org page.

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,000
And we're going to go
for the Windows

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,920
installer right here, 2.7.3.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,690
I'm going to click on it
and download that.

15
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,980
And then I'm going to show
that in the folder.

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,290
And I'm going to double
click on it.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,650
I actually previously
downloaded it.

18
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,060
I'm going to run it.

19
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,560
Install for all users.

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,030
Python, Python, security
check.

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,460
Say yes.

22
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,170
All right, that is super.

23
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,090
So now what it does by default
is put that right into your C

24
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,110
drive, Python 2.7.

25
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:03,340
And what you're going to want to
do is add that directory to

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,950
your path just like we
did before so that

27
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,960
we can get to it.

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,910
So let's do that.

29
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,030
So we're going to go here,
type Computer.

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,240
And go to System Properties.

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,780
I'm going to go to Advanced
System Settings over here and

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,790
do Environment Variables.

33
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,625
Go down to my Path Variable.

34
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,900
It's right there.

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,150
And I'm going to edit it.

36
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,060
I'll go to the end of it.

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,410
The separator, again, seems
to be a semi-colon.

38
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,930
So type C drive, so it goes
in C drive, colon

39
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,230
slash Python 2.7.

40
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,780
So I've done that.

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,650
I'm going to say, OK, OK,
OK, and kill that.

42
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,780
Now, if I bring up a terminal
window, command prompt, and

43
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,870
type Python, I get the
Python interpreter.

44
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,690
Print hello world.

45
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,560
And it prints hello world.

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,260
Excellent.

47
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,600
So now we have Python installed
on our computer.

48
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,940
Next step is that we need to
get PyMongo installed.

49
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,320
And we need to get the small
bottle framework installed.

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,550
So in the next lesson, I will
show you how to do that on a

51
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,800
Windows machine.

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,420
