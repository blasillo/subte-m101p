1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,210

2
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,060
And the answer is
it prints out 9.

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,830
And the reason is that this
code checks whether C is

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,400
included as a key
in this object.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,080
Which of course it is.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,480
And then it runs through each
number in this object, 1, 3,

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,420
and 5, and sums them up.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,410
Sum equals sum plus N. Sum will
start at 0, and then it

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,670
prints the sum, so it's the sum
of those three numbers,

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,920
which is 9.
