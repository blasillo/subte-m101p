1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,510
OK.

3
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,760
I'm going to go over the
solution to Homework 1.

4
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,670
In Homework 1, we asked you
to download a small tar

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,780
file and expand it.

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,380
I'm going to do that
right now.

7
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,740
And in that file, you'll
see there are--

8
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,830
there's one directory, a dump
directory, that has a bunch of

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,270
subdirectories and then has
one subdirectory, and then

10
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,890
there's some bson
files in that.

11
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,030
That's just a standard
dump file that you

12
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,560
get from Mongo dump.

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,030
And then there's 2 py files.

14
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,500
Then I run mongorestore.

15
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,770
On that dump, it created the
m101 database and brought the

16
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,270
collections in.

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,480
I'm going to go into Mongo.

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,230
I'm going to use m101 and
show collections.

19
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,735
The one we need is called
homework 1.

20
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:44,200
I'm going to look at homework 1
and see what's inside it and

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,160
see that there is one document
with an answer 42.

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,720
That's the answer to the
question of "The Ultimate of

23
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,960
Life, of the Universe and
Everything" from Hitchhikers

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,950
Guide to the Galaxy.

25
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,850
So that's the answer
to Homework 1.

26
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,100
