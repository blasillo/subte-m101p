1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,650
OK, and the answer is six,
because in order to show a

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,100
blog post with all of its
comments and tags, you'd have

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,430
to hit the post table.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,660
Only an author ID here, so you
have the access the author's

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,860
table in order to get
the author's name.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,080
You'd have to go to
the comments table

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,780
to display the comments.

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,390
And to know which comments go
with which post, you'd have to

10
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,590
go to the post comments table.

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,010
And to know what post tags you
had, you have to go to the

12
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,520
post tags table, the
tags themselves

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,790
are in the tags table.

14
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,620
So you'd actually have to access
six to display one blog

15
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,170
post in a relational system.

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,420
