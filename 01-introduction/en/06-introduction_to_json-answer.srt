1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
All right.

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,530
And the answer is these are
all valid JSON documents.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,050
So this is a pretty standard
JSON document.

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,720
You've seen that before,
the first one.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,170
The second one is a JSON
document where the third key

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,140
has a value of an array, which
is completely legal.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,570
And in the next one, this
might be a little

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,300
surprising to you.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,950
But the value for the B key
is an empty JSON document.

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,170
That is legal.

11
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,430
And in this one, the C key in
the third one has an array,

12
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,045
the first element of which is a
JSON document with a key and

13
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:30,230
a value, and then there
are two other values.

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,630
And the last one is simply an
empty JSON document, which is

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,880
a legal JSON document.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,920
