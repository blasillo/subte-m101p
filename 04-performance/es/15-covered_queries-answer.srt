1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,180
The answer is that only the
last one is a covered query.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,750
So let's go through it slowly.

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,760
So this query right
here only looks at name,

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,010
and it can use this index,
name, date of birth.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,550
And then this final index
shows name, date of birth,

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,390
and suppresses _id.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,800
This is completely eligible
to be a covered query.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,420
This one above right here,
where it looks just at name

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,640
but returns hair
and name and _id,

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,270
the issue is here that
if it looks just at name,

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,500
it's going to use
this index right here.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,170
It's not going to
use this index.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,090
It can't use this index for name
very well because, of course,

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,350
it's not a left subset.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,705
So it's not going to
choose this index at all.

17
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:46,080
It's going to
choose a name, date

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,550
of birth index for this
query, the third one, and then

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,320
it's going to have
to produce hair

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,770
and it can't do that
so it's going to go

21
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,854
to the documents for that.

22
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:55,769
You can test that out.

23
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:57,490
You can create some
collections to see.

24
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,140
Now, this one over here
looks just at name,

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,019
and here, once again, it's going
to choose name, date of birth.

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,700
But what's even worse is that
_id is going to be produced

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,740
by this query and that won't
work because _id is not

28
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,170
in the index.

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,000
And this one over here
is looking just at _id,

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,556
which is going to
use the _id index.

31
00:01:17,556 --> 00:01:19,930
And so name and date of birth
do not appear in that index

32
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,850
at all, and so hence, it will
need to go to the documents.
