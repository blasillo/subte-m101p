1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,210

2
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,930
All right.

3
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,840
The answer is a
lot of them work.

4
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,870
So db.example.find.explain
does work, and these work, too.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,330
The example.explain.find,
this is very similar.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,080
In this first case,
we're getting a cursor

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,670
and then we're
calling explain on it.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,880
In this case, we're getting
the explainable object

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,090
and then we're calling
find an explainable object.

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,580
In this case, explainable
object, in this case,

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,500
it's an explainable object and
we assign it to a variable,

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,330
and then we use that
variable to call find.

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,890
And in this final
case, we got a cursor

14
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,120
and then we called
explain on the cursor.

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,370
The second case doesn't
work because what

16
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,710
we did is we called
db.example.remove,

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,130
which doesn't return a cursor.

18
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,150
See, that's the secret.

19
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,150
That's why we had to move
to this new interface.

20
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,190
And then we tried
to call explain

21
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,106
on it, which will not
work, and you can try it

22
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:50,310
and confirm that yourself.
