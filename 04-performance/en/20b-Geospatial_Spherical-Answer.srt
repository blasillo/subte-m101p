1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499
 

2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:01,800
And here is the answer.

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,930
The answer is db.stores.find,
specifying again the loc,

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,360
because, again, this collection
stores the locations in loc.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,490
$near $geometry.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,950
This is the geo JSON
document following.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,060
Type "Point," with the
coordinates minus 130,

8
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,160
39 with with a max distance
of 1 million meters.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,040
And that would be the query
that would return everything

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,000
within that search radius, and
it would return it from closest

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,690
to furthest away.
