1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,700
OK.

3
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,080
And the answer is that the first
three of these are all valid.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,855
You could insert this document
where is a is an array

5
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:09,150
and b is a scalar.

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,490
Or a is a scalar
and b is a scalar.

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,670
Or a is a scalar
and b is an array.

8
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,840
But the one where is
a is an array and b

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,740
is an array-- that's not
legal in a multikey index.
