1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
All right.

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,719
And the first two are correct.

3
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,320
And we went over
them in the lesson,

4
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,910
which is that you will get a
smaller index if it's sparse.

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,170
And you are able to
create unique indexes

6
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,680
when some of the documents
lack the key that you

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,450
want to index on.

8
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,920
So that's true.

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,070
But the last two are not
true, because the third one

10
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,370
is actually pretty
much a non sequitur.

11
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,160
Your indexes can only be
multikey if they are sparse.

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,480
That's not true.

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,870
And the index can be
used to sort much more

14
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,200
quickly in all cases.

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,644
So this is not true.

16
00:00:28,644 --> 00:00:30,310
The "all cases" part
is what's not true,

17
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,759
which is to say that you can't
use a sparse index to sort,

18
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,010
as I showed you, if using
it would omit any documents

19
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,380
from the final result.

20
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,590
So that's not true.
