1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,040

2
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,540
All right.

3
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,390
Now you know about the
MMAP storage engine.

4
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,030
Let's talk about the Wired
Tiger storage engine.

5
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,324
This storage is not turned on
by default inside MongoDB in 3.0

6
00:00:09,324 --> 00:00:10,990
but it offers some
interesting features,

7
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,910
and for a lot of
workloads, it is faster.

8
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,630
The first is that it offers
document level concurrency.

9
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,980
Now, we don't call it document
level locking because it's

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,870
actually a lock free
implementation which

11
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,410
has an optimistic concurrency
model where the storage

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,810
engine assumes that two
writes are not going

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,880
to be to the same
document, and if they are

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,340
to the same document,
then one of those writes

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,780
is unwound and has to
try again, and it's

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,780
invisible to the
actual application.

17
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,440
But we do get this
document level concurrency

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,210
versus collection level
concurrency in the MMAP storage

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,600
engine, and that's a huge win.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,880
The second is that this storage
engine offers compression,

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,680
both of the documents
themselves, of the data,

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,044
and of the indexes.

23
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:55,710
And it's beyond the
scope of this course

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,910
to go over exactly how all this
works, but just very broadly,

25
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,240
the Wired Tiger storage engine.

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,550
We talked before about
having a 100 gigabyte file,

27
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,620
and if you had a 100 gigabyte
file on disk using Wired Tiger,

28
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,480
Wired Tiger itself
manages the memory that

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,210
is used to access that file.

30
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,500
So the file is
brought in in pages,

31
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,890
and the pages can
be of varying sizes,

32
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,490
and Wired Tiger
decides which blocks

33
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,660
it's going to keep
in memory and which

34
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,190
blocks to send back to disk.

35
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,380
So it's because Wired Tiger
is managing its own storage

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,230
that Wired Tiger can,
for instance, compress.

37
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,230
You don't want to keep
it compressed in memory

38
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,530
because when you have
read access to a document,

39
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,730
if they hit memory and
they hit your cache of data

40
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,750
that's in memory, you don't
want to have to decompress it.

41
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,830
And with Wired Tiger,
you don't have to

42
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,900
because it's kept in
the clear in memory,

43
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,720
but before they write out the
disk, they can compress it,

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,610
and that saves a
tremendous amount of space

45
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,070
for certain types of data.

46
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,237
And if you think about
MongoDB, the keys

47
00:01:57,237 --> 00:01:59,070
are often repeated in
every single document,

48
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,490
so there's a lot of
opportunities for compression.

49
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,020
Wired Tiger is also an
append only storage engine.

50
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,438
There are no in place updates.

51
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,979
That means that if you update
a document in Wired Tiger, what

52
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,479
they're going to
do is they're going

53
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,039
to mark that the document
is no longer used

54
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,080
and they're going to
allocate new space somewhere

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,530
else on disk and they're
going to write it there.

56
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,900
And eventually, they reclaim the
space that is no longer used.

57
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,360
This can result in writing
a lot of data sometimes.

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,240
If you have very large documents
and you only update one item,

59
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,190
Wired Tiger is going to have
to write that entire document

60
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,540
again, but it's this
append only nature

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,660
of the way they
store the data that

62
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,100
allows it to run without
locks at the document level

63
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,540
and gives them the
document level concurrency.

64
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,170
So overall, it's often faster.

65
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,610
If you want to start the
database with the Wired Tiger

66
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,080
storage engine,
you can do it using

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,780
the flag -storageEngine and
then after that, wired tiger.

68
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,610
My handwriting's
kind of poor, so I'm

69
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,080
going to show you on the
screen what this looks like.

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,454
So the first thing
you want to do

71
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:04,460
is kill your existing
mongod process,

72
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,980
and then you can create a new
directory, for instance, called

73
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,640
WT for Wired Tiger, and
then you could start Mongo

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,730
by telling it to use that
directory, dbpath Wired Tiger.

75
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,880
That tells it to use this
Wired Tiger directory.

76
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,211
I'll do .WT, although I
don't think I need that.

77
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:22,710
Actually, I don't
think I need that.

78
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,790
dbpath WT, put the
files in that directory,

79
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,740
and then I would need to give
it the storageEngine flag

80
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,610
and then say Wired Tiger.

81
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,600
So mongod -dbpath.

82
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,410
Normally, it defaults into
/data/db if you don't give it

83
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,030
any arguments, but we need a
new directory because the Wired

84
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,230
Tiger storage engine cannot open
the files created by MMAP V1.

85
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,950
So if you have been running
MongoDB on your computer,

86
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,160
on your desktop, for
example, and you kill it,

87
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,900
and you try to start up using
storage engine Wired Tiger,

88
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,350
it won't work because it
can't read those files.

89
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,390
So if we hit Return, you can
see that Wired Tiger is starting

90
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,000
and it's listening on
27017, and that if we just

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,260
clear the screen and
connect using Mongo,

92
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,750
then we can do
db.foo.insert name andrew.

93
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,330
And now we've written something
into a Wired Tiger based

94
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,830
storage engine inside MongoDB.

95
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,610
And if I want to know that it
is a Wired Tiger based storage

96
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,339
engine, I'm in the
test database right

97
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,790
now and the foo collection.

98
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,405
If you call
db.foo.stats, you can

99
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:25,530
see it tells you a bunch
of things about the stats,

100
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,320
about this collection, including
its size, which is small,

101
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,550
and that it has this Wired Tiger
key that tells you that it's

102
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,210
a Wired Tiger collection.

103
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,380
So that's it.

104
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,651
Now it's time for a quiz.

105
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,900
Which of the following are
features of the Wired Tiger

106
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,710
storage engine?

107
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,010
Check all that apply.

108
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,520
In place update of documents,
power of two document padding,

109
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,550
document level concurrency,
compression, and turbocharged.

110
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,320
Which of these are true?
