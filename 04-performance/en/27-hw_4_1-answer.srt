1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,160

2
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
OK, and the answer is that the
first one can't use an index

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,700
because it asks for brand GE,
and as you can see, the only

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,360
index that has brand in it is
a compound index and it's in

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,210
the second column, so
it can't use it.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,880
And then the next one is brand
GE as well, so that won't use

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,920
the index, but it sorts by
price, and there is a

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,210
index on the price.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,030
So that second query can
utilize an index.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,890
The next one looks for prices
that are greater than 30 and

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,600
less than 50, and it
sorts by brand.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,075
So this can use an index because
the price query can

13
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:42,820
use an index, and this sort
won't use an index.

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,820
And the last one is to look up
a brand GE, which we know

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,720
cannot use the index, and then
sort by category and brand in

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,230
that order.

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,620
Category and brand.

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,040
And you can see here that there
is a category and brand

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,300
index, but the issue is that
it's in the wrong order.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,660
So its category ascending, brand
ascending, and we try to

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,970
do a category ascending, brand
descending index, which it

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,610
will not do.

23
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,600
So for that reason, that
answer is not chosen.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,133
