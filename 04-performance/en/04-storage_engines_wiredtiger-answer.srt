1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499

2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,820
All right, and the answer is
that you get document level

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,150
concurrency because it's
a lock-free implementation

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,550
for most paths
through the database,

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,850
and you get compression,
which is great.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,320
You do not get power-of-two
document padding,

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,940
that is something that is
a feature of the [? NMap ?]

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,069
storage engine.

9
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:20,360
And you do not get in-place
place updates of documents.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,890
If you try to update
a document, it

11
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,770
will wind up rewriting the
entire document to disk.

12
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,850
And it is not turbocharged.

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,020
Turbocharged is a
real thing with cars.

14
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,760
Turbocharged refers to the
idea of using the exhaust fumes

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,820
from a car, running
it through a turbine,

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,720
and adding extra power
to the drive train

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,240
by using some of the energy in
the exhaust fumes coming out

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,450
of the back of the car for
a fossil fuel based car.

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,330
So turbocharged is a
real thing, but not

20
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,680
in the WireTiger
storage engine, maybe

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,760
in some other
high-performance engines.
