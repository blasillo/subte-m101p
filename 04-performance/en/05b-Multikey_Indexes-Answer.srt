1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,310

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,060
OK.

3
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,760
So this is a multi-key index.

4
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,360
And so the answer is that the
first three are valid because

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,520
the first one inserts an array
here and an item in b.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,540
And then the second one is just
two strings, an a and b.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,650
The third one is a string
in a and an array in b.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,170
The fourth one is two arrays.

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,220
And you can't have two parallel
arrays in a multi-key

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,740
index, so that would
not be valid.

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,990
