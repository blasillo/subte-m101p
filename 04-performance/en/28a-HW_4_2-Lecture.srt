00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,310
All right, in this problem you
are given the query and the

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,980
explain output and you have
to figure out which of the

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,880
following facts are true from
the explain command.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,100
It's a little subtle because we
aren't shown the index and

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,130
to figure it out you have to
look at the actual names of

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,700
the index, over here, and the
names of the index that are

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,050
used can tell you a lot
about what's going on.
