1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,619
OK.

3
00:00:00,619 --> 00:00:04,059
And the answer is that only
the third one is correct.

4
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,180
MMAP does not offer
document level locking,

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,770
it offers collection level
locking, so that's not true.

6
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,894
MMAP isn't the one
that creates the power

7
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:13,810
of two-sized documents
when they're inserted--

8
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,460
this was a little bit subtle--
but MongoDB makes the decision

9
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,670
that it wants to
allocate a document that

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,160
is power of two sized.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,400
MMAP doesn't care.

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,660
MMAP is built on top of
the MMAP system call.

13
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,570
That is absolutely true.

14
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,420
And the final one is false
because MongoDB does not

15
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,036
manage the memory used by MMAP.

16
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:31,910
Instead, it's managed
by the operating system

17
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,050
itself and it
decides what to swap

18
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,340
in and out from this large file
that is mapped into memory.
