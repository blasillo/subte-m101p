00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,690
In this problem, you are given
just the indexes that exist on

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,880
a particular collection, it's an
e-commerce collection, you

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,380
can see indexes exist, and
based on that you have to

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,410
figure out which of these
queries would

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,660
potentially hit an index.
