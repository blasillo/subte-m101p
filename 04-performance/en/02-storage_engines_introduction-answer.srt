1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,090
And the answer is that a storage
engine controls the data file

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,720
format, how the data is written
to disk to persistent storage,

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,307
and it definitely
affects the format

5
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:10,390
of the indexes, which we
talked about a little bit

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,470
in this lesson.

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,220
It doesn't affect the
overall architecture

8
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,770
of a cluster in terms
of the replication,

9
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,519
or how data gets
transferred from server

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,060
to server to provide
fault tolerance-

11
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,069
they're not affected
by the storage engine.

12
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:22,610
And the wire protocol
for the drivers

13
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,480
isn't effected at
all because remember

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,350
that the drivers talk to the
server and the server talks

15
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,340
to the storage engine.
