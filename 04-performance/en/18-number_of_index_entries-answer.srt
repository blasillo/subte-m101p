1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,480
And the answer is 100.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,760
If we have to move the document
and if there's an

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,900
array that's indexed, and if the
array has 100 items in it,

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,180
then there are 100 index points
that need to be updated

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,470
inside the index that point
to this document.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,720
