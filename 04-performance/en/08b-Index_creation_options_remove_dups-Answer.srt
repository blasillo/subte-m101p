1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280

2
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,770
All right.

3
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,810
And the answer is that the
documents will be deleted

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,570
forever and ever, Amen.

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,630
So be very careful with that
drop dups option when creating

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,880
a unique index.
