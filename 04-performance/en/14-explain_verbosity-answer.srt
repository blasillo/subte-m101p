1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,328
And the answer is right here.

3
00:00:01,328 --> 00:00:03,160
It scanned nearly
a million documents

4
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,110
and returned 10,000 of
them in 619 milliseconds.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,030
And if you go through, you
can see that pretty clearly.

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,760
Here it is.

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,680
There is 619 milliseconds.

8
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,969
And you can see that,
in the execution stats,

9
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:17,760
that it examined nearly
a million documents

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,860
and that it returned
10,000 documents.

11
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,460
And the other answers are
all variations of false.

12
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,575
And this was a full
collection scan by the way.

13
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:26,870
All right, and
that's the answer.
