00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:01,720
Welcome to week four.

3
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,800
Congratulations on
making it to this point.

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,812
This week we're going to
talk about performance.

5
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:07,270
The performance of
computer systems

6
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,460
is driven by a variety
of factors including

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,910
the performance of the
underlying hardware-- the CPU,

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,460
the disk, and the memory.

9
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,451
Once you've chosen a
hardware configuration

10
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:17,950
it's going to be your algorithms
that determine performance.

11
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,144
And for a database-backed
application

12
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:21,810
it's going to be the
algorithms that are

13
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,220
used to satisfy your queries.

14
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,170
There are two ways
you can impact

15
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,100
the latency and throughput
of database queries.

16
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,790
One is to add indexes
to collections.

17
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,250
And two is to distribute the
load across multiple servers

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,890
using sharding.

19
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,050
This week we're going to
talk about performance.

20
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,610
But to make matters
just a little bit

21
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,290
more interesting in MongoDB 3.0
we introduced pluggable storage

22
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,470
engines.

23
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,880
A storage engine is the
software that controls

24
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,190
how the data is stored on disk.

25
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,630
We're also going to talk about
how the choice of storage

26
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,460
engine impact performance.

27
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,340
Now performance is
normally the domain

28
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,820
of database administrators.

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,190
But good developers
understand performance

30
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,849
and write their applications
with performance in mind.

31
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,280
And they can de-bug the
performance problems

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,580
within their applications.

33
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,380
Let's get started.
