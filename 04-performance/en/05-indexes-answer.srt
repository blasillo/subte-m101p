1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,810
OK, and I'm sure everyone
got this right, that yes,

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,410
indexes have a greater impact
than any of these other things.

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,826
And the way to
think about this is

5
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:08,910
if you have a really
large problem,

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,250
it's probably be more
efficient to eliminate 95%

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,900
than to hire faster workers.

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,250
And all of these
items here is really

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,780
about hiring faster workers.

10
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,339
So indexing is extremely
important database performance,

11
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:22,130
and you definitely want
to make sure you've

12
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,640
indexed the keys that
are going to result

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,920
in a large percentage of your
queries hitting the index.
