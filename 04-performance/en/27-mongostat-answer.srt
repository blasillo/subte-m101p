1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,510
And the answer is that they
get getmore column does concern

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,499
the number of requests
per time interval

4
00:00:05,499 --> 00:00:07,040
to get additional
data from a cursor.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,970
That is correct.

6
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,110
And the faults column
does appear only

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,600
for the mmapv1 output.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,210
That's the number
of page faults.

9
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,030
The other ones are not true.
