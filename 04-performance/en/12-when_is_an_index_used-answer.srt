1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,200

2
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,560
And the answer is, if there's
an index on a, and b, and c,

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,700
then the first one can't because
it's b and c that's

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,800
specified and the a
is not included.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,340
The second one can, because
a is specified.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,390
The third one can't use it to
satisfy the find because c is

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,835
what's specified in the criteria
and that's not a

8
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:22,670
leftmost set of this index, but
it can use it to satisfy

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,680
the sort, right here.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,040
Because it has these items
in sorted order, a, b.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,160
Now, the last one looks similar
to the third one and

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,140
that's looking for c, which of
course, it can't use index to

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,790
search on, and then it sorts
on a minus one b.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,200
Now, the database can't use the
index because this sort

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,550
order is not the same as the
index that's sorted.

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,690
So, the index is sorted in a
ascending, b ascending, we've

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,550
asked for a descending,
b ascending, and so

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,480
it can't use it.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,930
Now, interestingly enough, if we
had specified just a minus

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,480
one, even though the index is
sorted on abc, it knows that

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,990
it could just reverse it and
get a minus one out of it.

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,390
And if you try to do that, if
you create a situation like

23
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,290
this, and you do the explain
command, you'll see that

24
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,340
refers to a reversed version of
a, b, and c, which you can

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,030
use to satisfy a query like
this, if only a is specified

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,050
in descending order.

27
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,580
Just a little interesting
tidbit.

28
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,830
All right.

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,430
