1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,090
All right, and the answer is
that it's the first choice

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,410
here, will turn the
most documents.

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,920
It will return all three
documents The find doesn't

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,130
have any criteria
so it's going to

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,980
return every document.

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,825
It's going to sort by title, but
we're hinting that we want

8
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:16,930
it to use the basic cursor, so
it'll find every single one of

9
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,310
these documents.

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,110
Even though it's sorted by
title, which is a sparse index

11
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,740
and which does not have an entry
for the third document,

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,870
if you recall the
third document

13
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,420
does not have a title.

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,000
All these other three items
will not return three

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,770
documents, they have
the same problem.

16
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,500
The second one sorts by title
and doesn't give a hint and so

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,330
it will use a title index and
the title index is sparse and

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,700
the third document does not have
an entry and this will

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,230
return two documents.

20
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,930
This one, name does not equal
Kevin, that is every document,

21
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,120
but again sorting by title,
that's going to filter out the

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,290
one that doesn't have a title
because the sort is on that

23
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,240
sparse index.

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,010
The last one specifically tells
us to hint and use the

25
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,070
title index.

26
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,270
Same problem, it's going to
return two documents.

27
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,720
So only the first one will
return all three documents, so

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,090
the first one returns
the most documents.

29
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,340
