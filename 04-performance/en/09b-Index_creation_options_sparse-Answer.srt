1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
 

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,170
OK, and the answer is that
it will return no documents,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,890
because we've hinted to
use this title index.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,382
The title index is
sparse, and we're asking,

5
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:13,840
it's a little bit
subtle, but we're

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,690
asking for documents
where title is null.

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,440
And by definition the
sparse index on title

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,676
omits documents
where title is null,

9
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:23,050
because that would mean the
title is not in the document.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,350
And so, in fact, the
answer is no documents,

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,960
because the query
uses the index,

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,000
and there are no documents
with title null in the index.
