1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499
OK.

2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,500
And the answer is the
first three are correct

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,400
and the last one is not correct.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,220
We [? didn't ?] talk about this,
really, about when any of this

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,750
changed, because
it didn't change.

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,080
Which is to say that
index creation is

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,510
in the foreground by default,
not in the background.

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,080
So this last one is wrong.
