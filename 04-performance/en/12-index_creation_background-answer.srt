1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,380
And the answer is the first
three are true, and the last

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,620
one is not true.

4
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,893
A mongod instance can only build
one background index at

5
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:07,510
a time per database.

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,460
The database server will
continue to take requests, but

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,150
you'll be blocked in the
shell that you used

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,250
to create the index.

9
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,440
So you might think that that's
an indication that other

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,670
people are blocked, but it's
not, you can continue to work.

11
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,635
I'm not sure we told you
that, so you might have

12
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:23,650
had to guess at that.

13
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,560
Creating an index in the
background takes longer than

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,610
creating it in the foreground,
this is certainly true.

15
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,850
And in Mongo 2.2 and above,
indexes are created in the

16
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,900
background by default.

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,409
That's not true.

18
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,320
They're still create it in the
foreground by default.

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,970
In Mongo 2.2 and above the big
change is that there's now a

20
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,000
pre-database writer lock.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,390
That is the big change.

22
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,550
So that even if you run them in
the foreground, you're only

23
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,130
going to be blocking writers
from the same database, versus

24
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,660
all the databases across
the whole server.

25
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,115
