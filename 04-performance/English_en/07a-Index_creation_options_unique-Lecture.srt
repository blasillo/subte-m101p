1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,470
The indexes that we've created
so far have not been unique.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,770
A unique index enforces a
constraint that each key can

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,600
only appear once in the index.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,360
That is not true for the indexed
that we've created.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,500
Let's create another
collection here,

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,410
db.stuff.insert.

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,115
And I'm going to
insert a thing.

9
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:19,830
I'm going to insert a pear.

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,280
And now I'm going to create an
index on this collection.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,680
Sorry, I mistyped it.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,800
I need to have the collection
in there.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,640
So we created an index
on this collection.

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,780
And I can create multiple
items with thing pear.

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,090
So I'm going to put
another one in.

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,010
I'm going to put one in
with thing apple.

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,530
But what if I wanted to
create a unique index?

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,430
All right, if I look
in stuff right now,

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,910
I can see my indexes.

20
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,950
I can see I've got this
index on thing.

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,490
Let's drop that index.

22
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,160
And now let's try to create
an index that's unique.

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,710
So we do that with ensureIndex
command, with now our second

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,230
document after the first one
with unique being true.

25
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,220
And this is going to enforce the
constraint that each key

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,420
can only appear once.

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,890
Now it won't allow me to do that
because, in fact, there

28
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,310
is a conflict.

29
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,430
So let's get rid of
that conflict.

30
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,170
So db.stuff.remove,
let's remove one

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,800
of these right here.

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,330
I'll remove one of
these pears.

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,430
That should do it.

34
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,290
And now if I try to create
the index, I can do it.

35
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,390
And if I call getIndexes on
this collection, I can see

36
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,630
that there's a new field now.

37
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,750
It says unique true for
this secondary index.

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,100
And if I try to insert
something, I'm going to show

39
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,220
you the collection again.

40
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,590
And then try to insert something
that violates the

41
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,870
index, like, for instance,
asserting an apple.

42
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,770
I get a duplicate key error
because I can't have more than

43
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,130
one item in the collection
that has a

44
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,560
key with thing apple.

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,320
So you'll notice that the _id
index is not shown is unique.

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,419
But we know and we've told
you that it is unique.

47
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,000
So this is actually a slight
vagary of the database that it

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,990
doesn't tell you that that
particular index is unique.

49
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,810
But if you try to insert into
it, you'll certainly see that

50
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,420
it is unique.

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,050
So I'm going to try to insert
into the collection.

52
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,235
I want to do this, id:1, b:1.

53
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:30,410
So now I'm inserting something
with _id of 1.

54
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,100
An if I try to insert another
documents with _id of 1, I get

55
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,840
a duplicate key error, exactly
the same way as I do on the

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,740
index on thing, even though in
fact the database does not

57
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,220
tell you that the index
_id unique.

58
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,610
But it is a unique index.

59
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,340
And so just to review, to create
a unique index you

60
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,980
specify this unique:true option
in the second document

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,620
after the ensureIndex.

62
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,400
All right, so now it
is time for a quiz.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,250
Please provide the mongo shell
command to add a unique index

64
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,070
to the collection students on
the keys student_id, class_id.

65
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,980
And please type that
right there.

66
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,230
