1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320

2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,560
And the answer is the odometer
mileage, right?

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,030
Because there's, let's
say most people drive

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,560
cars 100,000 miles.

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,030
There's 100,000 different
odometer readings that we

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,900
could choose from that might
narrow down the car, whereas

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,340
the manufacturer, I don't know
how many manufacturers of cars

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,280
there are, but maybe
100 or 1,000.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,330
The weight of the car, most
cars weigh under 10,000

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,560
pounds, so that's 10,000,
assuming that you don't bring

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,000
it out to any decimal points
it's just 10,000 different

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,400
possibilities, and there aren't
that many colors.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,370
So I think the odometer mileage

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,900
would be the most selective.

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,540
So again, this is important to
think about selectivity when

16
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,010
designing indexes because that's
going to help you get

17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,260
better performance.

18
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:39,750
