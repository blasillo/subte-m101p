1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,760
OK.

3
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,640
And the answer is
db.students.ensureIndex class

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,560
colon 1 student underscore
name colon 1.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,020
So, that would be the
way it works.

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,940
I didn't say ascending, but I
hope you figured out that it

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,190
was supposed to be ascending.

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,230
