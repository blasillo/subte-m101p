1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,560
OK.

3
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,710
Let's move on to a slightly
different way of looking at

4
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,380
your data--

5
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,170
namely, counting.

6
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,190
Everything that we've learned
about querying so far has been

7
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,860
retrieving documents from the
database, but occasionally,

8
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,890
you just want to get a count of
those documents that match

9
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,770
a particular criteria.

10
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,620
MongoDB has a mechanism for
doing this, which is called

11
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,710
the count command.

12
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,310
And the count command has a
convenient helper syntax

13
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,230
similar to the "find" syntax.

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,620
Specifically, if you query for
scores, having say, the type

15
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,360
"exam," then the find method
will retrieve whatever

16
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,050
documents have that
particular field.

17
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,630
And again, if you want, you can
iterate through results

18
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,900
interactively by typing "it."

19
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,820
If you want to merely count the
number of documents that

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,050
have type exam, instead of
executing the find method, you

21
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,700
can call the count method.

22
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,810
And there are 1,000.

23
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,100
If you recall how we created
this collection, with that

24
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,440
nested loop in a previous
section, we inserted an exam

25
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,550
document for each student ID
up from zero up to, but not

26
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,790
including, 1,000.

27
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,140
So the count method more or
less performs an analogous

28
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,110
function to what
a query does--

29
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,560
namely, counting up all the
documents that match a

30
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,010
particular criteria.

31
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,260
There's not much more
to it than that.

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:07,630
All right.

33
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,170
Let's try a quick quiz
on counting.

34
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,890
How would you count the
documents in the scores

35
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,630
collection where the type was
"essay" and the score was

36
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,590
greater than 90?
