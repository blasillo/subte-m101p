1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,480
OK, and the answer is that the
second one is correct.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,410
The one that specifies this
type quiz and score dollar

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,260
greater than 20 and dollar
less than 90.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,350
You notice that they're
quoted there.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,230
The first one is not correct,
because it doesn't specify

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,770
that the type is quiz.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,240
The third one is actually kind
of backwards, but if you're

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,390
just getting started
with Mongo, it's an

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,420
easy mistake to make.

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,210
Instead of having the key first
then a document this

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,080
specifies the criteria for the
number, it actually starts

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,780
with dollar greater than
or dollar less than.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,300
But this is not correct.

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,790
And the last one would be
correct if not for the fact

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,500
that the quotes were left off
those two literals, which

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,250
won't work inside Python and
PyMongo, but would inside the

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,500
Mongo shell.
