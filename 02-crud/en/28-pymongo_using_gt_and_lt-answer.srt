1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,770
OK and the answer
is the second one,

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,330
that you would need to specify
the query like this with

4
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,288
['type':'quiz','
 score':{'$gt':20, '$lt':90}].

5
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:08,920

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,850
These are all, again, quoted.

7
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,795
Now the reason why the
other ones are wrong,

8
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:14,170
the first one is
wrong because it

9
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,670
doesn't specify that it
needs to be of type quiz.

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,850
This third one is wrong
for a more subtle reason.

11
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,450
Because rather than saying the
score needs to conform to this

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,580
condition that's specified
as a separate document,

13
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,870
you could see that we
distributed this out and now

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,536
it's '$gt':'$gt':[? 'score':20 ?],
'$lt':'$lt':[? 'score':90 ?].

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,820

16
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,930
You might think this
makes sense but it's

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,840
not the way you specify
greater than, less than.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,130
You instead, first, put
the key, and then you

19
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,450
have the condition within
this subdocument specified

20
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,320
essentially as the
value of the key.

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,320
The last one is wrong
just because there's

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,930
no quotes around $gt or $lt.

23
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,420
You need to protect
these literals in Python

24
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,390
to make sure that they're
interpretive strings.
