1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,040
Now that we know how
to use find and

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,390
find one inside Pymongo.

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,230
Let's talk about how
we do projections.

5
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,320
Projections would let us select
out particular fields

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,560
to pull during the query and
not pull the rest of them.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,510
So let's go back to that query
we had before where we asked

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,970
for everything with 'type'
'exam' out of the scores

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,440
collection that we were using.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,130
And this time let's also create
a secondary dictionary,

11
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,300
which I call selector, where
we would like to retrieve a

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,820
student ID and not show the.
underscore id field.

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,660
So we're suppressing and
retrieving specifically

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,530
student underscore id.

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,740
And again, you'll notice these
quotes around these literals.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,260
And then right here we're
calling in Pymongo scores,

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,060
which is the handle to the
scores collection, dot find,

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,830
and then the query, and then
what I call the selector.

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,370
And then we iterate through
and print out the results.

20
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,670
So what happens when
we do that?

21
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,670
Let's see.

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,790
Let's go through and run it.

23
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,880
And as you can see, it
retrieves the student

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,840
underscore id only, and
suppresses the underscore id

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,440
field, which is exactly
what we want.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,460
All right, time for a quiz.

27
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,280
Which of the following
statements--

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,740
these are Python statements--

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,300
could work using Pymongo
depending on variable names,

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,430
because the variable names
have to be legal.

31
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,000
But let's presume they are.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,130
I have to select out just the
student ID from the scores

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,820
collection using a find command,
so very similar to

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,820
what we just went over.

35
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,140
Which of these is correct?

36
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,390
