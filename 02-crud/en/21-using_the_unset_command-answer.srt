00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,040
So this code should do it.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,250
db.users.update.

4
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,200
user name colon Jimmy.

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,830
$unset.

6
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,370
Interests colon 1.

7
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,670
This will remove the interest

8
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,920
it from the document.

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,010
