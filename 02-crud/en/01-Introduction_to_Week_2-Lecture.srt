Welcome to week 2 of M101P,
MongoDB for Developers.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,430
This week, we're going to be
going over how to get data

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,740
into the database and how to
take it back out, how to

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,590
update it, and how
to delete it.

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,590
I'm doing this week by Richard
Kreuter one of our lead

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,219
consulting engineers.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,050
He's going to go through how to
put data in a database and

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,670
take it back out from
the Mongo shell.

10
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,240
And then after that, I'm going
to go through the same

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,900
operations but using
Python and PyMongo.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,210
It should be a fun week,
so let's get started.
