1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,180

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,620
In this problem, we asked you
to add the code to the blog

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,550
that would allow people to sign
up for the blog and log

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,740
in to the blog.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,190
You needed to work
in two places.

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,730
The first one was in this add
user code in userDAO.py.

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,820
You needed to add this statement
right here and

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,450
insert the user record right
here, self.users.insert(user).

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,170

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,790
And the second place you needed
to work over here in

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,540
validate_login.

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,200
You needed to find the user
and the user collection.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,520
And the way you do that is
self.users.find_one.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,830
And then you specify underscore
ID and the user

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,510
name that was given
by the user.

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,900
That pulls out the document.

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,765
Then you compare
the passwords.

18
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:44,530
And that's where you
needed to work.

19
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,740
So this is the finished
solution.

20
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,860
Let's see if it works.

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,270
So we'll go here.

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,090
And we're going to run it.

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,690
Oh.

24
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,510
It looks like Python's
already running.

25
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,140
So let's just kill all Python
and see if that does it.

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,555
Yup.

27
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:01,110
And then right here,
we're going to run

28
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,870
the validation script.

29
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,030
And you can see that
it did work.

30
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,220
And it got a validation code,
which is blanked out here.

31
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,900
But you'll get the real
one when you run it.

32
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,660
And let's see if
the blog works.

33
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,580
Here we go.

34
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,360
Let's log out.

35
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,810
Let's create a new user.

36
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,822
Test101, password test,
verify test.

37
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:26,300
All right.

38
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:33,460
Now let's log out and log
in as this test101 user.

39
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,790
And we're able to log in.

40
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,560
So it seems to work properly.

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,780
And the final part of that, of
course, would be to go into

42
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,160
the users collection,
so db.users.find.

43
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,980

44
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,640
And oh, there's a whole bunch of
test entries that were put

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,880
here by the program.

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,230
Let's do a find where
the underscore ID is

47
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,250
this test101 user.

48
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,640
Pretty, print that out.

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,690
There we go.

50
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,470
You can see test101
is the user.

51
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,820
And here's the hashed
password.

52
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,090
So that all seems to work.

53
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,340
