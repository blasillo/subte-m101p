1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Well, it should look something
like this--

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,220
db.catalog.find, and then a
price whose corresponding

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,350
selector is dollar.gt.10000
and a reviews.rating whose

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,100
selector is dollar.gte.5.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,239
This will match any document
where the price field is

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,050
greater than 10,000 and the
reviews field contains an

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,020
embedded document that has a
rating that's greater than or

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,330
equal to 5.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,380
Now this is a little subtle,
but the querying inside of

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,760
arrays that we do is also
applicable with dot notation.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,340
So in this case, even though
reviews is an array of

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,800
documents, looking for a rating
inside of the reviews

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,760
will also traverse into the
array in what I hope is an

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,130
intuitive fashion.

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,220
This is a fairly common thing
to do in MongoDB.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,470
