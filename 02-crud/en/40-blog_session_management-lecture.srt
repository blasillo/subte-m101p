1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,210

2
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,230
OK, so I've created a
user in the blog.

3
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,050
That user is me, erlichson.

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,510
And now I want to go through
some of the session management

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,680
that goes on behind the scenes
to present this welcome page

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,880
with the name erlichson on it.

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,830
So it all happens
through cookies.

8
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,510
And if you go into MongoDB after
you create a user when

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,680
you've completed the first
part of the homework this

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,880
week, you should see
the following.

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,100
I'm going to use blog, and
then I'm going to show

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,040
collections.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,650
And you're going to see
three collections--

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,360
sessions, system.indexes,
and users.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,823
Let's focus on the sessions
and users collections.

16
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:40,880
So, db.users.find--

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,580
you can see here that there's a
user in this collection with

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,880
the ID erlichson, and that's
me, with a hash

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,390
version of my password.

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,010
And we're going to give you the
logic to do the hashing.

21
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,260
And there's also something in
the sessions collection.

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,290
And that is an association
between my web

23
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,870
session and my username.

24
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,640
So there's this long random,
and that's going to be put

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,030
into the browser cookie.

26
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,350
And then it's associated
with my username.

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,430
Now if we go here into the web
browser, I've installed a

28
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,530
cookie utility.

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,780
And if you click on it, you
can see the cookie that my

30
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,590
browser is presenting
in this session.

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,010
And you can see that it starts
with ab and ends with f.

32
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,840
And if you go here, you can see
ab ends with f, that's the

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,550
exact same string that's
in the sessions table.

34
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,070
So how does this session
management work?

35
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,390
Let's go over it.

36
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,220
When the welcome page is
presented, it's done through a

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,450
get request.

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,370
And what happens is the browser
sends a request via

39
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,410
HTTP with the cookie present to
your application, which is

40
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,620
written in Python.

41
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,130
And this is the blog
application, and, of course,

42
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,780
it uses Bottle to take
the HTTP requests.

43
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,570
And then the application
makes a request

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,020
using PyMongo to MongoDB.

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,010
And it presents this session
identifier, this session ID,

46
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,430
and then it gets back
a username.

47
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,100
And then when the application
responds, it responds with the

48
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,330
username embedded in
the HTML page.

49
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,300
And then it says "welcome
erlichson." And it does this

50
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,700
through this process.

51
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,720
Now let's look at one other
flow, which is the flow for

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,050
logging in.

53
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,750
So let's go through that.

54
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,110
When you log in, there's
a login page.

55
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,190
And that login page
has a username and

56
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,100
password field on it.

57
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,370
And it's presented via
a get request.

58
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,910
You're going to put username
and password in, and it's

59
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,540
going to be sent via a post
request to your blog.

60
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,280
And what the blog is going to
do is check it against the

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,130
credentials inside the users
collection inside MongoDB.

62
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,950
And if it looks like a valid
login, it's going to create an

63
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,440
entry in the sessions
collection.

64
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,100
And that's sessions collection,
it's going to have

65
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,000
this long session ID which is
going to become the cookie.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,430
So it's going to respond back
with the session information

67
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,370
if it's a valid login.

68
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,320
And then what's sent back your
browser is actually a redirect

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,890
to the welcome page with
the cookie set.

70
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,465
And so your browser is going
to round trip that, and say

71
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,525
all right, and then redirects
this to the welcome page so

72
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:20,950
then it's going to get
on the welcome page.

73
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,250
And so this is a round trip
because the browser gets a

74
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,610
redirect and then does a get
on the welcome page.

75
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,570
And what does that get?

76
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,210
It's now going to present the
cookie that it saw during the

77
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,640
redirect, and that's going
to produce this "welcome

78
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,525
erlichson."

79
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,790
All right, so that's the flow
of how session management

80
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,550
works inside the blog.

81
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,790
And now I'm going to show you
some of the internals of the

82
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,530
blog so you're ready for
this week's homework.

83
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,780
