1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,570
And the answer is, and you
really could just experiment

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,170
to find out this answer.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,930
Pymongo will return
an empty document.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,090
And this is generally true.

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,970
We haven't really shown this,
but any time you project onto

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,540
a key that doesn't exist, it's
essentially ignored by Mongo.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,230
And nothing is returned
for that.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,320
And of course if there's nothing
returned at all, then

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,040
what you get is an
empty document.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,910
That's what you get the
answer to the query.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,160
