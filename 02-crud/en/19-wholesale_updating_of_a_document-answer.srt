1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,230
Well, it would be this one.

3
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,010
The update will discard any
information that exists in the

4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,390
document with underscore ID
Texas and deposit only the

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,990
information that's present
in the second

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,560
argument to the update.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,380
So in this case, you'll have
a population value, but

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,260
landlocked will be discarded.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,950
Again, you can't change the
underscore ID value of a

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,710
particular document, so that
will never be touched by an

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,960
update of this sort.
