1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,160

2
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,730
So it goes like this.

3
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,820
db.scores.find, $or and then the
array, having as the first

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,690
element, score $ less than
50, and then score $

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,650
greater than 90.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,500
This query will return all those
documents that have the

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,760
score that's less than 50 or
that have the score that's

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,640
greater than 90.
