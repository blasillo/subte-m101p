1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,780
OK, and the answer is that the
third and fourth are correct,

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,420
and the first and second
are wrong.

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,750
So in the third, that we do
stuff dot update underscore ID

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,680
bat, and then we set the
document, I underscore ID bat,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,560
friend ball, cousin glove,
upsert true.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,130
And in the last one, we take
advantage of using the dollar

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,700
set command here.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,860
So we don't have to specify
the underscore

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,170
ID bat on the right.

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,640
And again, upsert true.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,470
The first one is wrong because
we don't specify the

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,430
underscore ID bat on the right
hand side in the document that

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,530
we're setting.

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,690
And the second one is wrong
because we don't

16
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,940
set upsert to true.

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,107
