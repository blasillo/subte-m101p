1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,100

2
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,700
It should look something
like this.

3
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,380
db.scores.find type
colon exam.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,040
And then these cursor
modifiers can

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,060
occur in any order.

6
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,410
I put the sort and then the
skin and then the limit.

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,420
But you could put them
in a different order.

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,790
Sort by score, negative
1 for descending.

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,480
Skip by a count by 50.

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,940
And limit to a count of 20.
