1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,420
OK, and the answer is only
the third one is correct.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,940
And in the third one, notice
that there's two documents

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,700
sent to the find command.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,970
The first one is empty, which
finds all of the students.

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,980
And it projects out that it
wants the student underscore

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,490
ID field key from the document,
and suppress the

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,620
underscore ID.

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,810
The first one is wrong because,
if you'll notice,

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,480
there is no query
document here.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,900
It actually puts the projection

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,080
as the first document.

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,000
This is going to find everything
with student ID one

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,850
and underscore ID zero.

15
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,240
And then the second one is
wrong for two reasons.

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,260
First, it doesn't put this
projection document as a

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,100
second argument to find, and
also, it doesn't suppress

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,900
underscore ID.

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,280
Our third one is correct.

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,520
And the fourth one is wrong only
because it doesn't quote

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,360
these literals, the student
underscore ID and the

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,610
underscore ID.

23
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,310
