1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,190

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:03,570
Moving along to some more
update operators.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,350
Occasionally, you want to
be able to remove a

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,810
field from a document.

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,030
For example, in my People
collection, if I want to

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,110
remove Jones's profession,
I can.

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,300
One way to do it, of course,
would be to do a wholesale

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,960
replacement specifying all
of the fields except for

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,270
profession, but this is somewhat
cumbersome to do if I

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,890
happen not to know what
fields exist in

11
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,760
that document in advance.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
And so we have another operator
analogous to dollar

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,230
set, and that operator is
called dollar unset.

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,120
This will remove the field and
its value from the document

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,660
that matches the specified
criteria, and so the

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,020
profession is gone.

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,420
This is occasionally useful, for
example, to perform schema

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,850
change manipulations when the
application requirements

19
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,350
change, or occasionally to
model certain kinds of

20
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,780
transformations of your data.

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,470
For instance, rather than
storing a null value if a

22
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,960
piece of information is not
present, you can add and

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,290
remove fields to a document
as the information becomes

24
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,210
present and relevant, or becomes
irrelevant and no

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,380
longer necessary.

26
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,150
This is one aspect of MongoDB's
schema-less nature.

27
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,620
All right, let's have a quiz.

28
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,020
Write an update query that will
unset the Interests key

29
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,980
in the following document in the
collection called Users.

30
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,720
So the document has username
Jimmy, favorite color blue,

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
interests the array, debating
and politics.

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,770
