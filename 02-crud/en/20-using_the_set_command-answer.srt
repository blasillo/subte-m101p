1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,361
The answer should
look like this.

3
00:00:02,361 --> 00:00:03,730
db.users.update.

4
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,790
The first argument, which
specifies what document to

5
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,189
update, has user name
colon spelunker.

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,350
And the second argument, which
specifies how to update the

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,920
matching document, says $ set.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,310
And then country to RU.

9
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,560
