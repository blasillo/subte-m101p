1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,350

2
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:00,820
That's right.

3
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,120
The first two will, In fact, the
order of these operations,

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,540
$lte, $gte, does not matter.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,530
Again, this third option here
doesn't work, in fact, because

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,600
MongoDB's sorting and range
comparison operations are

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,290
case-sensitive, in effect, and
only compare in an Ascii sort

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,540
of fashion.
