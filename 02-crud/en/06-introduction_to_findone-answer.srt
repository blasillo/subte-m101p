1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,200

2
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,050
If you keyed in something like
this, you got it right.

3
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,300
db.users.findone.

4
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,030

5
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,400
The first argument to "findone"
is this document

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,710
where the field username has
the value "dwight" and the

7
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,150
second argument to "findone" is
a document where the _field

8
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,650
has the value "false" and email
field has the value

9
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,270
"true."

10
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,050
As it happens, you can
alternatively specify _ID with

11
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,990
the value 0 and email
with the value 1.

12
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,300
0 1 1, in this context, are
treated as analogous to false

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,610
and true, respectively.

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,900
But those details are up
to your preferences.

15
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,150
