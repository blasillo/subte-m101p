1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,380
Let's go a little bit further
into our examination of

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,770
querying for arrays by finding
out about one more operator

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,580
that's specific to looking
at array contents.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,080
Just as a reminder, we have the
following in our accounts

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,080
collection.

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,700
Let's embellish it slightly
by adding some more data.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,500
At this point, we have a handful
of accounts containing

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,200
various combinations
of favorites.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,640
Again, as a reminder, if it's
a little hard to read these

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,560
things because they're longer
than the width of the

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,920
terminal, you can tack dot
pretty on to the Find

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,790
operation in order to get them
to print out in a slightly

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,270
more indented format.

15
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,120
So we have a variety of
combinations of favorites.

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,320
Suppose you wanted to query for
all those documents that

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,950
have both pretzels and beer
in the favorites array.

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,800
Well, there's an operator
for that.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,570
The $all operator matches any
document that has all of the

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,730
specified elements inside the
array in the field that you're

21
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,760
looking at.

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,960
And the operand to the $all
operator is a array.

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,510
And the elements inside that
array can occur in any order

24
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,050
in the corresponding field
in the documents.

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,069
So for example, Howard has
favorites pretzels comma beer

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,060
in that order.

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,240
But Irving has favorites beer
comma pretzels comma cheese in

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,320
that order.

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,940
Another way of putting it is
that the operand on the

30
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,160
right-hand side of the $all in
the query has to be a subset--

31
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,920
possibly not a strict subset,
possibly equal to the set--

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,220
of the things that are the
values in the field that's

33
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,480
queried for in the Find.

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,770
That is to say, Favorites has
to contain beer and pretzels

35
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,550
in any order and may contain
some other things.

36
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,910
Finally, there's one more
operator that has to do

37
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,120
tangentially with arrays.

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,230
Although it's not specifically
about querying inside of

39
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,330
arrays, although you can use it
with the feature that Mongo

40
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,050
has to look into arrays.

41
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,450
Specifically, just like in SQL,
Mongo's query language

42
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,320
has an operator $in, which takes
a list of strings and

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,040
returns only those documents
where the corresponding

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,890
field-- in this case, Name--

45
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,330
has a value that's either
Howard or John.

46
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,550
That is to say, it's an
enumeration of all the values

47
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,450
that you're looking for
for the given field.

48
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,570
This feature composes, in a
hopefully intuitive fashion,

49
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,790
with the examination inside
of arrays that you've just

50
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,639
learned that MongoDB does.

51
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,380
So for example, if I look for
favorites $in beer or ice

52
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,500
cream, I should find any
document having a Favorites

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,790
field that contains beer
or contains ice cream.

54
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,140
And that appears to
specify everybody.

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,110
OK, let's have a quiz.

56
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,100
Which of the following documents
matches this query?

57
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:35,230
db.users.find, friends, $all
of Joe, Bob, favorites $in

58
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,480
running, pickles.

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,400
