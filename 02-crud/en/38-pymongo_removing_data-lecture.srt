1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,011

2
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:00,510
OK.

3
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,750
To remove data using
PyMongo, you're

4
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,400
going to use the delete-one
and delete-many calls.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,500
And they do pretty
much what you'd expect,

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,970
which is that if you
provide a filter,

7
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,232
and specify what documents
you want removed,

8
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:14,690
delete-one will
delete one of them,

9
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,550
and delete-many will delete
as many as match the filter.

10
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,800
Let's look at a short program.

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,008
Now you might remember that
we have the student grade

12
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:22,770
data before.

13
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,460
And I want to remove a
particular student record.

14
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,920
So this program is going to
remove the data for student

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,600
one, and then find all the data
for student 1 and print it out.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,110
So how does it do that?

17
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,640
Here's the removal code.

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,230
You give it a student ID.

19
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,080
And it connects to
the school, database,

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,510
and the scores collection.

21
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,660
And then it calls delete-one,
which student ID being student

22
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,659
ID passed in.

23
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:44,950
This is the literal student ID.

24
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,910
And this is the value
of the variable.

25
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,910
And then it's going to
print the number removed.

26
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,034
And that's going to come
from result.deleted_count.

27
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,920

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,810
So notice that when
we call delete-one,

29
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,020
we get back a result.

30
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,360
And the result is a
structure that includes

31
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,350
a number of items deleted.

32
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,260
It's under deleted_count.

33
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,349
After that, we call
find_student_data

34
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,110
at the bottom.

35
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,360
And find_student_data
is going to find

36
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,930
all of student data pertaining
to a particular student.

37
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,630
It's gonna call find
for a student ID,

38
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,690
with the student ID value
for the student ID variable.

39
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,360
And it's gonna
iterate the documents,

40
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,850
and it's going to
print them out.

41
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,840
And that's it.

42
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,640
OK.

43
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,151
So let's see what happens.

44
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:23,650
Alright.

45
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,910
We're going to invoke the Python
interpreter on this program,

46
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,970
which is called
remove_student_data.py.

47
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,760
And you can download this.

48
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,580
OK.

49
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,830
So it called delete-one.

50
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,342
So it removed one record.

51
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:36,550
And then it searched for
the data for student ID one,

52
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,040
and it found two
more items in there.

53
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,300
And the reason it found
two more items in there

54
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,500
is that if you recall,
this grade data

55
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,830
has multiple items,
both quiz and homework

56
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,180
for each of the students.

57
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,660
So I think there were three
documents for every student.

58
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,220
Now if we change this
program to call delete-many.

59
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,680
we should get rid
of the other two.

60
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
So let's do that.

61
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,180
Alright.

62
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,070
Now we remove two.

63
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,070
And we look for the
data for student ID one,

64
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,220
we get back nothing,
which is what we'd expect.

65
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,130
Now how do I know how to
print out the number removed?

66
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,860
Well, I didn't actually remember
this when I was recording this.

67
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,487
And once again, I went to our
documentation and looked it up.

68
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:16,070
And I want to show
you how that works,

69
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,028
because I think that it's
so important that you

70
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:19,510
be able to use documentation.

71
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,940
So I went to api.mongodb.org.

72
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,340
I clicked on Python.

73
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,140
I clicked on the 3.0 beta 1.

74
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,487
Now last time I recorded
this, it was 3.0 beta zero.

75
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:28,820
So there's been another release.

76
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,860
And I went here to
the API documentation.

77
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,840
I know that the delete-one
call is something that's

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,479
part of the collection class.

79
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,020
So I'm going to go
here, and then I'm

80
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,780
going to look for delete-one.

81
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,880
And if I go to
delete_one, it says

82
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,690
that it returns a DeleteResult.

83
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,290
And if I look at the
DeleteResult, and I click here,

84
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,580
then it says the DeleteResult
has a deleted_count.

85
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,830
You don't have to understand
what those are right now.

86
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,150
But this is how I figured
out how many items I actually

87
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,770
deleted with the call.

88
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,340
Alright.

89
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,760
Now it is time
for a quiz, which,

90
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,100
if you've been listening,
should be pretty easy.

91
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,600
Alright.

92
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,826
Here's the quiz.

93
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:07,450
When you're removing
data with PyMongo,

94
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,050
when you perform a delete,
you get back a structure,

95
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,430
and it tells you how
many items were deleted.

96
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,670
The name of the field that
contains that information

97
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,460
is which of these four?

98
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,550
num_deleted, num_removed,
deleted_count,

99
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,050
and removed_count.

100
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,620
Which one?
