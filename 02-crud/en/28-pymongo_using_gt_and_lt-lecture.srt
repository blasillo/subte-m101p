1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,390
Next, let's talk about how we
use the dollar greater than

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,400
and dollar less than operators
from inside Pi Mongo.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,570
Here's the same function
I had before.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,840
I defined my own find
command here.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,060
And here, I defined a query,
this is a Python dictionary.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,860
Again, we're going to look for
things with type is exam.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,310
In this case, we're going to
also constrain it to have a

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,760
score which is a dollar
greater than 50

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,900
and less than 70.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,880
Now, you'll notice again, that
the quotes are around these

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,250
operators in the dollar GT and
the dollar LT to make it work.

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,940
And then, we just go through
and we do the find on the

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,920
collection.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,370
Which, of course, collection
is defined for the file.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,190
Get a cursor and then go through
it one by one and

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,240
print it out.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,420
And if we do that--

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,290
This is the file I was using
find using greater

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,310
than and less than.

21
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,730
That's the file.

22
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,230
You can see that it will print
out the documents that are

23
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,190
satisfied by the query.

24
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,530
So there you go.

25
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,740
So time for a quiz.

26
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,270
Here's a snippet of code very
similar to the code I was just

27
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,300
showing you, and let's
see how carefully

28
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,530
you're paying attention.

29
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,500
You have to substitute and
figure out what you should put

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,170
in to do a query for all of the
quiz scores in that scores

31
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,430
collection where the score
is greater than 20

32
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,100
and less than 90.

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,210
And it's a multiple choice
question, you could just

34
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,460
choose one.

35
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,788
