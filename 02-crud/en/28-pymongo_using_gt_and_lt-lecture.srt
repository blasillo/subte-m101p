1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,900
Let's talk about how you use
the greater than and less

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,640
than operators inside PyMongo.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,530
And you already learned
about these operators

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,890
when using the Mongo shell.

6
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,552
And you can review that now if
you're not familiar with it.

7
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:13,260
I've written a small
program very similar

8
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,570
to the previous programs.

9
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,070
It's going to run
a query once again

10
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,150
against the scores collection
in the school database.

11
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,650
And this time,
the query is going

12
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,690
to be that it's looking
for documents of type exam

13
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,690
with a score, and
you see it's quoted,

14
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,520
is dollar greater than
50 dollar less than 70.

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,780
And this condition is
a document basically.

16
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,960
And it's the value
for the score key.

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,600
That's the way it's specified.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,400
And you can see
there's a comma here.

19
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,340
And you can put these
in either order.

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,420
It could be less than
70 and greater than 50.

21
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,200
It wouldn't matter which
order you put these in.

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,650
Then it runs this query.

23
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,180
And then it prints out.

24
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,220
It's going to print out
the first 10 documents.

25
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,800
So let's run that
and see if it works.

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,410
All right.

27
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,890
So I'm going to invoke the
Python interpreter on find

28
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,280
using greater than,
less than .py.

29
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,740
And when I do that, I get
out a bunch of documents.

30
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,090
They're all of type exam.

31
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,660
And they're all
between, the scores

32
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,032
are all between 50 and 70.

33
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:08,740
The student IDs are
varied because we had

34
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,010
no criteria for the student ID.

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,800
All right, now it's
time for a quiz.

36
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,420
And here's the quiz.

37
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,234
In the following
code below, very

38
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:18,650
similar to the
code we just wrote,

39
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,500
we have one line missing.

40
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,910
Tell us what the line would
be to search for all the quiz

41
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,320
scores that are greater
than 20 and less than 90?

42
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,000
So it's pretty similar to
what we did in the class.

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,230
And you can see
here is the code.

44
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,960
And here is the X's.

45
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,390
So here is the missing code.

46
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,610
And you're going to
need to figure out what

47
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,960
that line of code would be.

48
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,050
And here are the choices.
