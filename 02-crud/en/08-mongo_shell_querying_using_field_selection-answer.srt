1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,150
If you keep this in,
that's correct.

3
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,520
DB.scores.find and then the
first argument to find being a

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,320
document with type "essay"
and score 50.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,140
And then a second argument
defined that has the document

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,260
"studenttrue_IDfalse."
Alternatively, you could

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,050
specify "student1_ID0."

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,967
