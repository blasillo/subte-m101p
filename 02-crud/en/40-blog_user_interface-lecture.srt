1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,810
Now we're going to return to
building our blog, the project

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,720
that we're going to be
doing in this class.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,460
For this week's homework
assignment you're going to be

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,130
completing the user
registration

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,545
parts of the blog.

7
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:14,460
And I want to take you through
how those should work when

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,600
it's complete.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,060
And we're going to give
you all the user

10
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,920
interface for this.

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,280
So it's just going to be a
matter of putting in a few

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,070
Mongo commands into the code
to get it all working.

13
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,870
So we're going to go through
author registration.

14
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,230
An author, in order to write on
our blog, is going to have

15
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,300
to register.

16
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,330
And we're going to go through
user login and author login to

17
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,780
validate that they're allowed to
login with their password,

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,520
and logout.

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,120
And I'm going to show you how
those functions work.

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,520
And then after that I'll give
you a tour of the code.

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,410
So I'm going to run the code by
typing python blog dot py

22
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,130
and running the server.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,570
And now I'm going to go
to the web browser.

24
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,110
And I'm going to just go to
local hosts and hit return,

25
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,750
see what I see.

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,040
And it says, this is the
placeholder for the blog.

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,500
There aren't very many URLs that
are going to be defined.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,870
But one of them is going
to be signup.

29
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,260
And if you want to sign up for
the blog, you go to this URL

30
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,240
and you'll type the name.

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,980
I'm going to put in "erlichson."
And then I'll

32
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,760
just give a password of "fubar,"
something very

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,990
simple, and then leave
out my email.

34
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,610
And then I'm going to submit.

35
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,180
You'll notice the URL
is currently signup.

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,020
And then I get redirected
to a welcome page.

37
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,260
And it says, "Welcome
erlichson." And then it says I

38
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,490
can go to my blog home or
I can logout or I can

39
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,540
create a new post.

40
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,890
Create a new post won't work,
because we haven't

41
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,160
implemented that yet.

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,510
Logout will work fine.

43
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,790
In fact, why don't we log out?

44
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,440
And now it brings us
back to this page.

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,260
And if I click on Login, it
brings me back to this page.

46
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,390
And I'm just going to type my
username and password again.

47
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,729
And that sends me back
to this page.

48
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,120
So that's the way it works.

49
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,060
That's all it's supposed
to do at this point.

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,990
So what did it do behind the
scenes, and how does it work?

51
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,750
We're going to get to that in
some of these next sections.

52
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,200
So we'll start there.

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,520
And then we'll do another
section to show you some of

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,770
the underpinnings.

55
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,640
