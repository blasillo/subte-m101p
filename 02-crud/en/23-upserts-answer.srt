1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,350
Well, the answer is
the fourth one.

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,290
The upsert operation will
attempt to find a document was

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,730
username bar.

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,530
As stipulated, no such document
exists, however.

6
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,010
And so the upsert will actually
perform an insert

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,640
operation, creating a new
document with username bar and

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,940
interests equal to the
array cat, dog.

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,190
