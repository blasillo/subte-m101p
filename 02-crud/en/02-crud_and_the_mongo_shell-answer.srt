1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
That's right.

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,660
This week, we're going to go
over the basic document

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,260
Creation Retrieval Modification
and Removal

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,000
Operations, AKA the
CRUD operations.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,170
We will learn some features of
the MongoDB shell, which is

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,600
called Mongo, and we'll
understand how to manipulate

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,190
documents from Python.

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,900
We're not going to go into
detail this week of the

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,060
performance of MongoDB
operations or how to measure

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,820
that performance, or how to do
analytic-type operations over

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,680
MongoDB collections--

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,050
that is to say aggregation-type

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,890
functionality.

14
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,140
We'll cover those later
in the course.

15
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,360
