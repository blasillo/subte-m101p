1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,930
All right, and the answer
is the third one is correct.

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,040
The third one, you
call students.find.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,580
Then, you specify 'student_id':1
and you suppress the _id.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,390
So you give it a 0
value in the document.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,920
So why are the
other one's wrong?

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,720
Well, the first one
is wrong because it

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,762
doesn't have this projection
as a second parameter.

9
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:21,470
It actually has it as
the first parameter

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,640
so it's going to be
interpreted as a query.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,860
This one is wrong
for similar reasons.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,070
It's the first parameter,
not the second parameter.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,830
It's also forgets
to suppress _id'0.

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,000
The third one was right.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,310
The fourth one is wrong only
because these literals are not

16
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,220
quoted as they need
to be inside Python.

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,770
OK.
