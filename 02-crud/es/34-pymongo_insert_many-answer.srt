1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,160
All right, first of
all, this insert_many

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,740
doesn't specify an ordered flag.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,255
And by default, ordered is
true, if you don't specify

5
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:09,590
an ordered flag, which
means these inserts are

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,830
going to happen in order.

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,990
Also, you'll notice that
this insert right here

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,040
has an underscore ID that is
identical to this insert right

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,930
here-- this fourth insert.

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,780
So they're going to
conflict, and it's

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,940
going to get an error at
this point, which means,

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,670
of course, that this
final document is not

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,520
going get inserted.

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,540
So the answer is,
three documents

15
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,750
because insert_ordered=True
by default,

16
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,780
and the insert will stop
at the first failed insert.
