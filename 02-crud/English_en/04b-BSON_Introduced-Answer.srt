00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,740
That's right.

3
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,430
BSON supports strings--

4
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,240
which have to be validly
encoded coded UTF-8--

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,410
floating point numbers--

6
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,750
specifically, double-precision
floats-- if that matters to

7
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,510
you, arrays, objects,
and time stamps.

8
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,110
BSON does not support complex
numbers at the moment.

00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,360
