1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,310

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,100
Well, the answer is
db.scores.update score colon

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,800
less than 70.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,660
And then $inc score by 20.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,060
And then multi-true.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,010
If you did not specify
multi-true, the database would

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,590
update exactly one document
with score less than 70.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,910
But which document that was is
somewhat underspecified.

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,160
