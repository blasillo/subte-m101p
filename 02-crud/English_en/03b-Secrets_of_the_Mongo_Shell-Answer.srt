1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,430
Well, the third line takes the
variable x, looks inside the

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,340
value of that variable for the
field, whose name is the

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,470
value-- that's the value of the
variable y, which is a--

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,980
and it adds 1 to the
corresponding a

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,780
value inside of x.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,640
The last line prints out the
property of x whose name is a,

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,810
which was manipulated in
the preceding line.

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,120
So you should see the output 2
if you run this, or if you

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,370
just step through it mentally.

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,300
