1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,870
That's right, it's
the third one.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,560
The third document has a
friend's field that contains

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,020
all of the values,
Joe and Bob.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,050
And at least one of the values
in the list running in pickles

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,400
because it has pickles.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,680
If you compare that to the other
three documents, you'll

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,420
find that each of these other
documents either lacks Joe or

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,060
Bob, or has none of running
or pickles.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,310
