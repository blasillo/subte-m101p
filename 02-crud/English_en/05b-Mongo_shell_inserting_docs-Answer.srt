1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,610
That's right.

3
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,820
The answer is db.fruit.insert,
and the argument is a document

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,790
where the field name has the
value "apple," the field color

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,380
has the value "red," and the
field shape has the value

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,580
"round." the simple act of
inserting the document is

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,390
sufficient for creating
the collection.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,640
And in turn, the act of
creating a collection

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,750
implicitly creates the database
if no such database

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,000
already exists.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,650
