1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,830
OK.

3
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,770
And the answer that you might
want to keep them in separate

4
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,600
collections to reduce the
working set size of your

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,630
application.

6
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,120
Because if you're only going
to be accessing part of the

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,100
data, you don't want to bring in
both parts of the data set

8
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,220
into memory.

9
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,420
Or you may have a concern that
the combined document is going

10
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,710
to be over 16 megabytes
in size.

11
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,830
Now, this third one here--
to enforce foreign key

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,010
constraints.

13
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,300
Now, that's actually a reason
why you might combine them.

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,450
Since MongoDB doesn't have
foreign key constraints, well

15
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,150
you keep things a separate
documents.

16
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,500
You know, looking at this case
before, there was no guarantee

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,130
that this ID here is a foreign
key into this collection here.

18
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,530
And so it's possible to let
these things become

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,830
inconsistent if your program
is not careful.

20
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,830
And that's not an issue if you
have them embedded because

21
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,220
then this relationship that
depends on the IDs being

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,380
correct here to tie these
two documents

23
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,250
together wouldn't exist.

24
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,850
So that is not an answer
because, in fact, foreign key

25
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,710
constraints don't exist.

26
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,420
And if you want to avoid the
problem, you would actually

27
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,110
put them together, not
keep them apart.

28
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,360
