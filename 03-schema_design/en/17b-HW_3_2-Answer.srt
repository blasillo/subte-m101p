1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,600
In this assignment, we asked you
to modify the code so that

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,260
the blog will accept posts.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,220
And I want to take you through
how you do that.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:16,600
All the changes happen in the
BlogPostDAO.py file, which I

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,000
have up in front of you here.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,300
And the first one is
in insert_entry.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,640
So in insert_entry you need
to insert the post.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,220
And the line that was missing
is right here.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,470
You need to call
self.posts.inset(post).

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,490

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,170
And we built the post
for you over here.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,370
So you just needed
to insert it.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,940
That's all there was to that.

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,580
Now to get the posts--

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,790
for instance, for the
blog home page--

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,780
you needed to add this line
and call self.posts.find.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,040
But you needed to sort them by
the date descending and limit

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,610
them by the number of posts,
which get called with 10.

20
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,260
You have to call it with
a limit as well.

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,160
And this type of way of
specifying a sort is an

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,730
alternative way to
specifying it.

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,300
Instead of using tuples,
you can do it like this

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,700
in Python as well.

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,030
And I thought that was
a little bit easier.

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,760
All right.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,650
So the last place that you need
to make a change is in

28
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,680
this code over here,
get_post_by_permalink.

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,730
And in this case, you
just need to call

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,390
self.posts.find_one
right here.

31
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,600
And you to specify that the
permalink is the same as the

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,970
permalink that was sent in.

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,830
So this is the permalink key,
and this is the value.

34
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,750
And this is the variable,
permalink.

35
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,100
And that's all there
was to that.

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,810
And if you make those
changes, then the

37
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,270
blog will accept posts.

38
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,520
