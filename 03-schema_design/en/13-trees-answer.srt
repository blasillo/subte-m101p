1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,900
And the answer is that the final
one will find all of the

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,750
descendants.

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,890
So that might be a little
surprising.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,080
It looks for all documents where
ancestors is 34, and due

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,640
to the polymorphism around the
way our Razor handled, it will

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,700
look for all the documents where
34 is an element in the

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,920
ancestors array, which will give
you all the descendants

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,170
to the snorkeling document.

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,950
