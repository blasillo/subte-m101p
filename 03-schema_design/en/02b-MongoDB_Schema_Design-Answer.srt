00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,310

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,620
OK.

3
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,800
And the answer is that the
single most important factor

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,980
in designing your schema within
MongoDB is to match the

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,880
data access pattern of
your application.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,710
Match those data access patterns
because that's the

7
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,400
way you're going to get
the best performance.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,490
That's the way you're going to
get the most convenience of

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,990
programming within
your application.

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,240
