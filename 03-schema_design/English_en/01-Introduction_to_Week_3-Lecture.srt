00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,080
Welcome to week 3 of M101P.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,570
This week, we're going to
go over schema design.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,610
Now, I've told you that MongoDB
has a dynamic schema,

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,980
and that each document can
have its own schema.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,420
And that makes it a little bit
tough to decide what schema

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,180
each document should have.

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,120
In most applications, every
document has the same schema.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,860
But there's still choices
to be made.

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,030
You can embed data in a
document, or you could put

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,690
into its own collection.

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,430
And these decisions will have
an impact on performance and

13
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,940
ease of programming.

14
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,500
So for a series of use cases,
we're going to take you

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,920
through MongoDB's
schema design.

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,170
Let's get started.

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:35,840
