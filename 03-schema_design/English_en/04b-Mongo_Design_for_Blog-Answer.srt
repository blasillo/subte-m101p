1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,450
And the answer is that, of
these four, the only one

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,190
that's really not well-supported
is, providing a

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,650
table of contents by tag.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,050
To do that, we would probably
have to use the aggregation

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,630
framework to do some sort
of a group buy.

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,040
It wouldn't be that
easy to do it.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,840
But the other ones are pretty
well-supported.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,080
So we could certainly collect
the most recent blog entries.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,000
We would just do a find in the
collection and order them by

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,410
the date and then
just do a limit.

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,400
Collecting all of the
information for a single post.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,470
You saw that--

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,750
very well use of the
entire document.

15
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,360
The entire blog post is
contained in a single

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,560
document, so it's easy
to display that.

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,210
Collecting all the comments
by a single author.

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,960
This was a little tricky and
we haven't quite told you

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,590
enough about this.

20
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,630
But the answer is-- and let me
show you this document again.

21
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,490
It does support that very well,

22
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,580
provided you add an index.

23
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,190
You could actually add an index
on comments.author and

24
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,120
it will reach inside the array
and index that information.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,830
We haven't talked too
much about that.

26
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,000
But if you did that, then you
could do a find and find all

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,630
the comments by a
single author.

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,480
This is the find, is the
author of the comment.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,860
But, as I said, that last one
is not well-supported, which

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,050
is providing a table of contents
by tag, where you can

31
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,370
see all the blog posts
that are filed

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,100
under a different tag.

33
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,640
There's no easy way to do that
in this design because you'd

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,440
have to basically--

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,470
First of all, you have to look
for the entire collection,

36
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,850
pull out every one of these
tags, and you'd have to

37
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,780
organize it by tag.

38
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,560
You can do it with the
aggregation framework

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,110
but no other way.

40
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,360
