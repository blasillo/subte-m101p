00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,030
In this problem, we asked you
to modify the blog code so

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,550
that it would accept comments
on the blog posts.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,240
Now, there's only one place you
to make a change, and it

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,110
was in blogPostDAO.py.

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,010
But the flow of control starts
in blog.py where we have a

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,200
handler for a new comment.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,640
And, if you remember, the
comment form is at the bottom

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,560
of the post permalink page, and
when this gets called with

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,540
a post request, it pulls
different form elements, which

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,549
are hidden values in the
form, out of the page.

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,990
And then it retrieves the
post by permalink.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,740
So right here, if for some
reason a fake permalink was

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,900
passed in, it wouldn't
get the post.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,630
So if we can't find the post,
it redirects immediately to

16
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,130
post_not_found.

17
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,840
Otherwise, what it does is it
makes sure that the name and

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,000
the body is filled out, and
then it adds comments by

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,930
calling posts, add comment,
with the permalink, name,

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,080
email, and body.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,000
That goes right into
blogPostDAO.py.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,300
And after that's completed, it's
going to redirect back to

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,120
the permalink page with a get
request so that you'll see the

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,580
post itself, the blog post, with
a comment on the bottom.

25
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's see what happens
in blogPost.py.

26
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,000
There's only one place you
needed to work here, and it

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,010
was in the add comment
function.

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,050
You needed to add this update,
and you needed to look for a

29
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,355
document with a permalink
matching the permalink that

30
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:26,230
was passed in, and then push
a new comment on to

31
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,640
the comments array.

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,640
And then just for safety,
we have upsert=False.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,460
Although since we just checked
to make sure that that

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,890
permalink corresponded to an
existing blog post, it should

35
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,260
find a document.

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,260
But if for some reason it
didn't, it won't insert it

37
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,280
because upsert=False.

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,695
And manipulate=False does is it
tells the driver not to add

39
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:47,730
an underscore ID field if one
doesn't already exist.

40
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,140
But I don't think that matters
in this case because with

41
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,560
upsert=False it won't insert
anything unless it finds an

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
existing document.

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,580
OK.

44
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,970
This is the only place you need
it to work in this file.

45
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,760
In terms of getting the comments
out of the blog, that

46
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,270
sort of happens naturally
in the existing code.

47
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,920
Because in get_posts--

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,190
and you did write this
to find the posts.

49
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,750
But we've already had the code
to assume that the comments

50
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,880
are present and pass them in and
add them right here as it

51
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,920
created this new array of
dictionary elements, each one

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,430
containing a post.

53
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,480
So you kind of get
that for free.

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,750
Same thing on
get_post_by_permalink which is

55
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,980
the other place that it
would need to happen.

56
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,820
And get_post_by_permalink, it
looks for the post, and then

57
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,530
it returns it.

58
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,520
And if there's a comment
in it then the template

59
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,770
will display it.

60
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,520
