2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,010
And the answer is that, you're
going to need to use multiple

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,020
collections to represent a one
to many relationship, or I'd

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,450
recommend it whenever
the many is large.

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,530
For instance, in the example we
gave, people in the city,

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,720
it would be best if you brought
up people to be a

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,920
first class object, gave it its
own collection, and have

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,340
the city be its own collection
as well.
