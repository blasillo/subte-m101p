Welcome to week seven.

3
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,310
We are through the hard stuff.

4
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,690
This week, we're going to take
a break and we're going to do

5
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,830
some interviews with
some folks who are

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,700
using MongoDB in industry.

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,030
We're going to interview Jon
Hoffman from Foursquare and

8
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,480
Ryan Bubinski from Codecademy.

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,390
It's going to be a lot of fun,
and a lot easier than the

10
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,470
previous weeks.

11
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,320
There is no homework this week,
except for the final

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,400
exam, so sit back and enjoy.
