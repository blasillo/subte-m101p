1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,890
OK.

3
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,790
And the answer is that 52
and 22 will be returned.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,360
52 and 22.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,430
So what is this doing?

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,940
Well, first it's grouping by
a,b, and it's finding the max

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,310
value of c in that grouping.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,370
And then it's grouping just by
a and finding the minimum

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,940
value of those.

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,980
So I'll show you what it looks
like after the first stage.

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,810
So this is what it looks like
after the first stage where

12
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,610
it's grouping by a and b and
finding the max value of c.

13
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,760
And you can see that you have
97, 22, 52, and 54.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,670
And in that final stage, it
was grouping just by a and

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,130
finding the min value.

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,710
Well, if you group by a here,
you could see there were two

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,600
ones where a is one, the first
and second entry right here.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,340
And so it's finding the
min value of that.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,420
So it's finding 22 between
those two documents.

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,730
And then over these two
documents, it's finding the

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,600
min value of c, and so
it's finding 52.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,050
So 22 and 52, and that
was the answer.

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,390
22 and 52.

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,050
So that's how you can
reason your way

25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,300
through what it's doing.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,130
