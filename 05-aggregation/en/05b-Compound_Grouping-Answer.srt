1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,910
And the answer is that we will
get five documents in the

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,950
results set.

4
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,370
Because regardless of what
we're naming them--

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,715
Moe, Larry, and Curly-- we're
looking at unique values for

6
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:09,130
a, b, and c.

7
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,720
And if you look at these
documents, each of them is

8
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,310
unique except for
one duplicate.

9
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,540
So there's only one duplicate,
which is right here.

10
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,700
This has a, b, and c values
three, three and two, that is

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,870
the same as this document.

12
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,150
So other than that, every one
of them will create a unique

13
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,430
result document during
aggregation.

14
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,262
