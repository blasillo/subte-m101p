1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,700
OK.

3
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,170
And the answer is
db.products.aggregate, and it

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,170
looks exactly like I did before
where we $group and

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,795
then we have an _id
of category.

6
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:12,570
[INAUDIBLE]

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,750
manufacturer.

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,370
And we built a new item called
num_products, a new key called

9
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,150
num_products, where we sum 1
for each one by category.

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,400
That's the answer.

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,122
