1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,230

2
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,690
OK.

3
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,880
And the answer is
db.zips.aggregate.

4
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,320
And then we have an array.

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,990
And we're only running
a grouping stage, so

6
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,220
group and then _id.

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,500
We're going to group by state,
and then we're going to create

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,379
a new key called population.

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,970
In that population, we're just
going to sum the pop field,

10
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,280
$pop field.

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,530
That's the way it works.

12
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,270
