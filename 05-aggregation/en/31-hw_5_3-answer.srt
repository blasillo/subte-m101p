1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,830
In this problem, we asked you to
figure out who the easiest

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,640
grader on campus is.

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,580
Now, by easiest grader we meant
the person who has the

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,590
classes, or the class, with the
highest overall average.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,480
And to figure out the class
with the highest overall

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,960
average, you need to first
figure out the average for

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
each student, because there
are variable number of

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,440
assessments for each
student, and then

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,610
average those numbers.

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,200
So it was just a double group
by to figure it out, and a

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,890
single unwind.

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,940
So let's go through
that step by step.

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,830
First of all, this is the
way a document looks.

15
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,350
And I'll show it to you
here on the terminal.

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,900
So you have a student, and he
or she has, let's see, an

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,920
exam, a quiz, a homework,
a homework, a homework.

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,940
And we need to figure out the
average of these assessments.

19
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,430
Now, we also stipulated that we
are not to include the quiz

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,690
scores in the calculation.

21
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,680
So we're going to have to do a
little bit of filtering to not

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,760
include the quiz scores
in the calculation.

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,710
And we're going to get the class
ID which has the highest

24
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,740
average student performance.

25
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,150
So let's go through that.

26
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,209
All right, we start by
unwinding the scores

27
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,239
collection.

28
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,480
That makes sense, because we
want to figure out the average

29
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,580
for each student.

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,900
Then, we filter and make sure
that we don't look at any

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,410
document that has a scores.type
of quiz.

32
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,840
Now remember, when we were
unwinding the scores

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,780
collection, the scores was
originally an array of items

34
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,570
that had type in them.

35
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,590
And now, once they're unwound,
it's going to be scores.type.

36
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,490
We flattened it out
by one level.

37
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,060
So we just want to filter out
anything that's not a quiz,

38
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,960
and then we're going to get the
average for that grade of

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
that student.

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,540
We're going to group by the
student ID and the class ID,

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,160
because we want their average
performance in that class.

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,460
And then we're going to get the
average score that they

43
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,460
achieved using this
average operator.

44
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,960
And we're going to
name it average.

45
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,360
After that, we're going to go
through and we're going to

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,310
calculate the average
for each class.

47
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,816
So next stage of the pipeline
we're going

48
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:59,120
to do another grouping.

49
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,390
And we're going to group by the
class, and then take an

50
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,910
average of the average that we
had previously created in the

51
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,570
previous stage of
the pipeline.

52
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,100
Now at this point, we have a
bunch of documents that have a

53
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,980
class ID and an average score.

54
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,810
And we can just rank those
from highest to lowest.

55
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,290
And the one with the highest
average student performance

56
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,700
should be the one that we
consider to be easiest.

57
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,510
And if we do that, we can see
here if we scroll up, that the

58
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,980
answer is that class ID 1.

59
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,120
Here it is, right here.

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,580
Here's the result.

61
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,260
Class ID 1 has the
highest average.

62
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,910
Average of 64.5.

63
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,300
And class ID 1 was the
accepted answer.

64
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,550
