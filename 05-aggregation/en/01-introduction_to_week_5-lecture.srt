00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,750
Welcome to week five of M101.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,760
Congratulations, we are almost
done with the course.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,310
This week, we're going
to go over

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,120
the aggregation framework.

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,530
The aggregation framework has
its roots in the world of

7
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,550
SQL's group by clause.

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,230
If you've ever done a select
something something, group by

9
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,070
something something in SQL, the
aggregation framework in

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,250
MongoDB can answer a lot
of the same questions.

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,750
We're going to use it to
calculate sums, and counts,

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,340
and averages, and other
functions over entire

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,430
collections grouped
by certain values.

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,600
By the end of the week, you're
going to be able to write

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,480
simple aggregation queries that
answer a lot of the same

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,410
questions you were writing code
to solve at the beginning

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,450
of the class.

18
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,700
Let's get started.

19
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,390
