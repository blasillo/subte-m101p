1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,060
And the answer is
db.zips.aggregate, group by

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,060
_id the city, and then build up
a new array, postal codes

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,280
adding to set, the
_id Interesting--

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,950
we hadn't used that before--

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,170
totally legal.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,930
Now, don't get confused by the
double use of the underscore

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,210
id in this here.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,430
This first one right here
refers to the _id of the

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,120
resulting documents in
the aggregation.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,720
We're grouping by city.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,460
And this refers to the _id
values in the source documents

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,610
that we're running through
in the zipcode database.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,860
So they're different.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,090
