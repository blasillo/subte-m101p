1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,170
And the answer is there'll
be three documents.

3
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,720
And that there'll be three
documents because there are

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,220
three unique values of c
in this collection--

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,590
one, two, three.

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,770
It's either one, two, or
three values of c.

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,670
And so there are three
unique values of c.

8
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,320
And so we're going to get three
unique documents in our

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,150
results set.

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,230
All this aggregation function
does, in this case, is tell

11
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,530
you the unique values of c.

12
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,170
Cause it doesn't actually
aggregate anything else beyond

13
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,120
there, which you don't need
to if you don't want to.

14
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,630
But that's the way it
works for this.

15
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,880
And we'll give you
three documents.

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,770
