1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,600
OK.

3
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,820
And here's the answer.

4
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,160
It's db.zips.aggregate.

5
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,830
And then we have a $group stage,
where once again we're

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,560
aggregating on state.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,450
We're going to create a new key
called average population.

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,090
And then we're going
to calculate

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,250
that as $avg of $pop.

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,970
Now $avg is our operator.

11
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,370
And $pop is a reference to the

12
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,400
population key of the documents.

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,619
And you could run that on the
data that you downloaded if

14
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,700
you'd like, just to
see that it works.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,620
But you don't need
to for this quiz.

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,870
