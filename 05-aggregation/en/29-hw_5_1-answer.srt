1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,570
OK.

3
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,070
In this problem, we asked you
to go through and figure out

4
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,440
the most frequent author of
a comment on the blog.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,050
And you're supposed to import
the post data set and then use

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,410
an aggregation query to
find out the answer.

7
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,310
And the answer is going
to turn out

8
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,290
to be Elizabet Kleine.

9
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,890
So let's see how you do that.

10
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,820
Here's the aggregation query
that you need to run.

11
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,400
You unwind the comments, which
there's an array of comments,

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,320
if you recall.

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,740
And then you group it by
the comment author.

14
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,290
And then add one every time
you see a comment author.

15
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,440
You create this new num_comments
field.

16
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,409
And the value is this summing,
adding one each

17
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,380
time you see it.

18
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,540
Sort by num_comments minus one
to get it in reverse order.

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,070
And I just limited it to 10,
just to make it easier to see.

20
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,580
And if you do that, then the
answer is this right here.

21
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,710
You can see the answer
is Elizabet

22
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,790
Kleine has 503 comments.

23
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,040
And then it goes down
from there.

24
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,452
