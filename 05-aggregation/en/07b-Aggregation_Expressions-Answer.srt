1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320

2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,720
The answer is the first and
last must be used in

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,860
conjunction with sort, because
they look at the first or last

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,570
document, the value for
a certain key--

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,820
the first or last document
in the pipeline.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,190
And that documents aren't
necessarily ordered unless you

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,780
sorted them.
