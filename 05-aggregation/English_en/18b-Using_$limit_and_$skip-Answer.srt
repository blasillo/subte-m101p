1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,210

2
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,040
OK, and the answer is, there
will be zero documents in the

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,200
result set.

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,010
If you limit it to five
documents and then you try to

5
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,610
skip forward 10 in that
set, you're skipping

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,440
out of what's left.

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,760
So there's nothing left to
show, so it shows zero.

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,010
