1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,350

2
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:00,910
OK.

3
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,665
And the answer is
db.zips.aggregate, grouping by

4
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:09,060
_id by the state.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,770
Find me the max population
and assign it to a

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,650
new key called pop.

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,040
And that's pop, because
it's pop there.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,290
And that's the answer.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,200
