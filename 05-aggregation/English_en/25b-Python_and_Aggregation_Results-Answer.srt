00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Alright, and the answer is
the last three are true.

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:07,895
In mongoDB 2.6, by default, in the shell,
the aggregate method does return a cursor,

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,237
we saw that.

4
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:15,148
In 2.4 the previous version of mongoDB,
PyMongo returned a single document.

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,515
And in 2.6 PyMongo returns
a single document,

6
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:21,430
but optionally you can have it return
a cursor.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,611
And we did this because we didn't want to
break existing Python programs.

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,748
But with the shell, we, essentially
are not backwards compatible,

9
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:32,597
and if you have a Java script program
that usually aggregate,

10
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:36,315
it could be broken by
the new default in the shell.
