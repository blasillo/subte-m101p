1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,220

2
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,820
OK.

3
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,810
The answer is that the push
operator will do it.

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,890
If you think about it, if I
unwind, let's say, those tags,

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,270
and then I group by the rest of
the document, I could push

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,830
on the tags and it'll
essentially

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,720
recreate what I had.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,890
So, push is kind of the inverse,
if you will, of the

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,735
unwind operator.

10
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:24,520
It's a little tricky, but.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,530
Another option might be add to
set, and that usually does

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,600
work depending on if the
array was unique in

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,810
the original document.

14
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,120
But if it wasn't unique, and
then add to set won't recreate

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,660
the exact original array,
because if an item was in it

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,590
more than once, add to set
will only add it once.

17
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,840
