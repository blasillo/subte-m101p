1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
 

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,090
In this segment, I'm
going to show you

3
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,376
how to install MongoDB on a Mac.

4
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:06,000
In a subsequent
segment, we'll show you

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,250
how to install MongoDB on a PC.

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,500
Now, Mac runs a version of
UNIX, so installing on a Linux

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,390
machine is very similar
to installing on a Mac.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,490
OK, let's start by
going to a web browser

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,290
and finding the download
page for MongoDB.

10
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,920
We're going to do that by typing
"download MongoDB" into Google.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,170
We're going to go past all
of these advertisements

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,290
and go to the
first organic link.

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,279
You could see here it's
www.mongodb.org/downloads.

14
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:34,820
And then we're given
several choices.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,310
Now, we're on a
Mac, so we're going

16
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,880
to use the Mac OS release.

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,440
It's a 64-bit release for our
64-bit Mac operating system.

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,260
You should always use the
64-bit version of MongoDB

19
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,980
if you can, unless you're on
a 32-bit version of Windows,

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,000
let's say.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,150
32-bit versions of MongoDB are
only suitable for development

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,280
because they limit total
amount of data to 4 gigabytes.

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,710
Below this first row of
production download options

24
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,490
for the 2.6.0 release, which
is the current release as

25
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,950
at the recording of this video.

26
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,400
You'll notice, by the way,
that the stable releases always

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,610
have an even digit in
the second place here.

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,500
So 2.6 is a stable release.

29
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,060
You can also get
the older releases.

30
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,600
For instance, the last port
release of the 2.4 chain

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,160
was 2.4.10.

32
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,460
And you can get that
for Windows, Linux,

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,300
Mac OS, and Solaris,
if you want.

34
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,680
But we're going to download
the Mac OS version now.

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,300
So let's do that.

36
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,920
And now it's downloading.

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,330
It looks like it's a
total of 107 megabytes,

38
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,620
they are downloaded.

39
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,200
We're going to go into
a terminal window.

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,590
And I'm already in the
downloads directory of my Mac.

41
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,430
And I'm going to
"tar xvf" that file.

42
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,190
And you can see there tar XVF
is going to expand the tar ball.

43
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,330
It's created a
MongoDB OS X directory

44
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,660
right in my current directory.

45
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,850
I'm going to look at it.

46
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,740
And then I'm going to go into
that directory and look around.

47
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,307
You can see there's
the AGPL, the README,

48
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:00,390
and some THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES
in the bin directory.

49
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,020
We're going to send you
to the bin directory.

50
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,120
That's where the action is.

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,786
And If you look in
there, we see a bunch

52
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:08,590
of different executables,
including Mongo and MongoD.

53
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,568
And these are the most
interesting executables.

54
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:12,026
Mongo is the shell
that we're going

55
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:13,442
to use to connect
to the database.

56
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:16,400
And MongoD is the process that
actually runs the database

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
server.

58
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,615
So those are the
ones we're going

59
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:20,260
to concern ourselves
with right now.

60
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,250
By default, MongoDB puts
its data in "/data/db"

61
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,440
We'll let it do
its default thing,

62
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,460
so we want to create
a "data/db" directory.

63
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,730
So what I'm going
to do right now

64
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,990
is I'm going to become
root on this machine.

65
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,470
And now I'm root on the machine.

66
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,700
Let's just check that out.

67
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,980
Yes, I am.

68
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,350
And then I'm going to
"mkdir minus p /data/ db."

69
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,360
And then I'm going to
"chmod 777 /data/ db"

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,617
to make sure that anyone
can write that directory.

71
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:52,200
Now, that would not
be a good practice

72
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,285
for production
installation of MongoDB,

73
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,160
but it's fun for our
development environment.

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,690
It will let us run as a
non-privileged user and put

75
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,320
the files in "/data/db."

76
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,390
So I'm going to exit
out of the shell.

77
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,570
And now I'm going
to start MongoD.

78
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,010
And I'm going to do that
by typing "./mongod".

79
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,240
Now, I did "./" so that it will
look in the current directory

80
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,360
in case my path is going
to search anywhere else.

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,104
And when I do that,
it's going to start up

82
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:22,270
and it's going to print a
bunch of stuff to the log.

83
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,210
And you can see it says
it allocating its new data

84
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,960
files at data/db,
so that's all good.

85
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,050
It started up as version 2.6.0.

86
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,960
It warned me about
soft rlimits, which

87
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,239
are important in production,
but not important here.

88
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,280
And now that it's running
in this terminal shell,

89
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm going to need a new terminal
shell so I can run Mongo.

90
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,700
By the way, it's listing
on the port 27017, which

91
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,230
is the default port for MongoDB.

92
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,040
Now, let's open a
new terminal window.

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,900
So now we have a
new terminal window.

94
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,410
And I think I'm still in the
downloads directory-- yes, I

95
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,480
am.

96
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,020
So now I'm going to
run the Mongo shell.

97
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,970
Do that right now-- "./mongo"
to make sure I get the one

98
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,450
in the current directory.

99
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,790
And there we go.

100
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,270
It connected to
the local server.

101
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,340
It put me in the test database.

102
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,110
And then, just to make
sure that it works,

103
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,660
I'm going to insert a
very simple document.

104
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm going to put something
in the names collection.

105
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,925
"db.names.insert" of
document with one key,

106
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,760
with the key "name" with the
value "Andrew"-- my name.

107
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,905
I do that.

108
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:22,990
It tells me that it
inserted one document.

109
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,020
And if I look in the
collection "db.names.find",

110
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,790
I see there's my document
with an underscore ID,

111
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,670
this object ID, which
we'll explain later,

112
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,580
that was inserted
by the database.

113
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,360
And then a key of "name",
and a value of "Andrew".

114
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,310
And so at this point, MongoDB
is riding on this Mac.

115
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,930
And we are ready to use it.
